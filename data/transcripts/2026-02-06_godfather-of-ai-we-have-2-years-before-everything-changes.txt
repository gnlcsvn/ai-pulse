You're one of the three godfathers of AI, the most cited scientist on Google Scholar, but I also read that you're an introvert. It begs the question, why have you decided to step out of your introversion? Because I have something to say. I've become more hopeful that there is a technical solution to build AI that will not harm people and could actually help us. Now, how do we get there? Well, I have to say something important here. Professor Yoshua Bengio is one of the pioneers of AI, whose groundbreaking research earned him the most prestigious honor in computer science. He's now sharing the urgent next steps that can determine the future of our world. Is it fair to say that you're one of the reasons that this software exists? Amongst others, yes. Do you have any regrets? Yes. I should have seen this coming much earlier, but I didn't pay much attention to the potentially catastrophic risks. But my turning point was when ChatGPT came and also with my grandson. I realized that it wasn't clear if he would have a life 20 years from now because we're starting to see AI systems that are resisting being shut down. We've seen pretty serious cyber attacks and people becoming emotionally attached to their chatbot with some tragic consequences. Presumably they're just going to get safer and safer though. So the data shows that it's been in the other direction. It's showing bad behavior that goes against our instructions. So of all the existential risks that sit there before you on these cards, is there one that you're most concerned about in the near term? So there is a risk that doesn't get discussed enough and it could happen pretty quickly. And that is... But let me throw a bit of optimism into all this because there are things that can be done. So if you could speak to the top 10 CEOs of the biggest AI companies in America, what would you say to them? So I have several things I would say. I see messages all the time in the comments section that some of you didn't realize you didn't subscribe. So if you could do me a favor and double check if you're a subscriber to this channel, that would be tremendously appreciated. It's the simple, it's the free thing that anybody that watches the show frequently can do to help us here, to keep everything going in this show, in the trajectory it's on. So please do double check if you subscribed and thank you so much, because in a strange way you are, you're part of our history and you're on this journey with us and I appreciate you for that. So yeah, thank you. Professor Yoshua Bengio, you're, I hear, one of the three godfathers of AI. I also read that you're one of the most cited scientists in the world on Google Scholar, actually the most cited scientist on Google Scholar and the first to reach a million citations. But I also read that you're an introvert and it begs the question why an introvert would be taking this step out into the public eye to have conversations with the masses about their opinions on AI. Why have you decided to step out of your introversion into the public eye? Because I have to. Because since ChatTPT came out, I realized that we were on a dangerous path path. And I needed to speak, I needed to raise awareness about what could happen, but also to give hope that, you know, there are some paths that we could choose in order to mitigate those catastrophic risks. You spent four decades building AI. Yes. And you said that you started to worry about the dangers after ChatTPT came out in 2023. Yes. What was it about ChatTPT that caused your mind to change or evolve? Before ChatTPT, most of my colleagues and myself thought it would take many more decades before we would have machines that actually understand language. Alan Turing, founder of the field in 1950, thought that once we have machines that understand language, we might be doomed because they would be as intelligent as us. He wasn't quite right. So we have machines now that understand language and they, but they lag in other ways like planning. So they're not for now a real threat, but they could be in a few years or decade or two. So it is that realization that we were building something that could become potentially a competitor to humans, or that could be giving huge power to whoever controls it. And destabilizing our world, threatening our democracy. All of these scenarios suddenly came to me in the early weeks of 2023. And I realized that I had to do something, everything I could about it. Is it fair to say that you're one of the reasons that this software exists? You amongst others? Amongst others, yes. I'm fascinated by the like the cognitive dissonance that emerges when you spend much of your career working on creating these technologies or understanding them and bringing them about. And then you realize at some point that there are potentially catastrophic consequences and how you kind of square the two thoughts. It is difficult. It is emotionally difficult. And I think for many years, I was reading about the potential risks. I had a student who was very concerned, but I didn't pay much attention. And I think it's because I was looking the other way. And it's natural. It's natural when you want to feel good about your work. We all want to feel good about our work. So I wanted to feel good about all the research I had done. I was enthusiastic about the positive benefits of AI for society. So when somebody comes to you and says, oh, the sort of work you've done could be extremely destructive, there's sort of unconscious reaction to push it away. But what happened after ChatGPG came out is really another emotion that countered this emotion. And that other emotion was the love of the love of my children. And I realized that it wasn't clear if they would have a life 20 years from now, if they would live in a democracy 20 years from now. And having realized this and continuing on the same path was impossible. It was unbearable. Even though that meant going against the fray against the wishes of my colleagues who would rather not hear about the dangers of what we were doing. Unbearable. Unbearable. Yeah. Yeah. I remember one particular afternoon, and I was taking care of my grandson, a little bit more than a year old. Unbearable. Yeah. How could I not take this seriously? Like, I... You know, our children are so vulnerable. So you know that something bad is coming, like a fire is coming to your house, and you see you're not sure if it's going to pass by and leave your house untouched, or if it's going to destroy your house, and you have your children in your house. Do you sit there and continue business as usual? You can't. You have to do anything in your power to try to mitigate the risks. Have you thought in terms of probabilities about risk? Is that how you think about risk, is in terms of like probabilities and timelines or... Of course. But I have to say something important here. I think that's a good idea. This is a case where previous generations of scientists have talked about a notion called the precautionary principle. So what it means is that if you're doing something, say a scientific experiment, and it could turn out really, really bad, like people could die, some catastrophe could happen, then you should not do it. But for the same reason, there are experiments that scientists are not doing right now. We're not playing with the atmosphere to try to fix climate change because we might create more harm than actually fixing the problem. We are not creating new forms of life that could destroy us all, even though it's something that is now conceived by biologists, because the risks are so huge. But in AI, it isn't what's currently happening. We're taking crazy risks. But the important point here is that even if it was only a 1% probability, let's say, just to give a number, even that would be unbearable, would be unacceptable. Like a 1% probability that our world disappears, that humanity disappears, or that a worldwide dictator takes over thanks to AI. These sorts of scenarios are so catastrophic that even if it was 0.1%, it would still be unbearable. And in many polls, for example, of machine learning researchers, the people who are building these things, the numbers are much higher. Like we're talking more like 10% or something of that order, which means we should be just like paying a whole lot more attention to this than we currently are as a society. There's been lots of predictions over the centuries about how certain technologies or new inventions would cause some kind of existential threat to all of us. So a lot of people would rebuttal the risks here and say this is just another example of change happening and people being uncertain, so they predict the worse, and then everybody's fine. Why is that not a valid argument in this case, in your view? Why is that underestimating the potential of AI? There are two aspects to this. Experts disagree and they range in their estimates of how likely it's going to be from like tiny to 99%. So that's a very large bracket. So if, let's say I'm not a scientist and I hear the experts disagree among each other and some of them say it's like very likely and some say, well, maybe, you know, it's plausible or 10% and others say, oh no, it's impossible or it's so small. Well, what does that mean? It means that we don't have enough information to know what's going to happen, but it is plausible that one of the more pessimistic people in the lot are right because there is no argument that either side has found to deny the possibility. I don't know of any other existential threat that we could do something about that has these characteristics. Do you not think at this point we're kind of just, that the train has left the station? Because when I think about the incentives at play here, when I think about the geopolitical, the domestic incentives, the corporate incentives, the competition at every level, countries racing each other, corporations racing each other, it feels like we're now just going to be a victim of circumstance to some degree. I think it would be a mistake to let go of our agency while we still have some. I think that there are ways that we can improve our chances. Despair is not going to solve the problem. There are things that can be done. We can work on technical solutions. That's what I'm spending a large fraction of my time. And we can work on policy and public awareness and societal solutions. And that's the other part of what I'm doing. Let's say that something catastrophic would happen and you think there's nothing to be done. But actually, there's maybe nothing that we know right now that gives us a guarantee that we can solve the problem. But maybe we can go from 20% chance of catastrophic outcome to 10%. Well, that would be worth it. Anything any one of us can do to move the needle towards greater chances of a good future for our children. We should do. How should the average person who doesn't work in the industry or isn't in academia in AI think about the advent and invention of this technology? Is there kind of an analogy or metaphor that is equivocal to the profundity of this technology? So one analogy that people use is we might be creating a new form of life that could be smarter than us and we're not sure if we'll be able to make sure it doesn't harm us, that we'll control it. So it would be like creating a new species that could decide to do good things or bad things with us. So that's one analogy, but obviously it's not biological life. Does that matter? In my scientific view, no. I don't care about the definition one chooses for, you know, some system. Is it alive or is it not? What matters is, is it going to harm people in ways, is it going to harm my children? I'm coming to the idea that we should consider alive any entity which is able to preserve itself and working towards preserving itself in spite of the obstacles on the road. We are starting to see this. We're starting to see AI systems that don't want to be shut down, that are resisting being shut down. And right now, of course, we can shut them down. But if they continue to go in the direction of more and more intelligence and capability and they continue to have this drive to live, we could be in trouble. When you say AI systems that don't want to be shut down and are resisting attempts to shut them down, can you give me some examples of this? Yes. I assume people have been experimenting with chatbots, right? You can now have these agentic chatbots which can read from files in your computer, can execute commands in the computer, and so on. So with these systems, you can plant information in the files that they have access to, false information. Such as emails that say that the AI is going to be replaced by a new version. So now the AI knows that we're planning to shut it down. And it turns out we can read its thought. It has these internal verbalizations that we call chains of thoughts. And then we see that it's planning to do something about it. And then it does something about it. Depending on the circumstances, it might try to copy its code in a different computer or in place of the new version. Or it might try to blackmail the engineer in charge of the change in version. So these systems understand that we want to shut them down and they try to resist. When someone hears that and with knowledge of how previous technology was built, I immediately think, well, who put that in the code? Unfortunately, we don't put these things in the code. That's part of the problem. The problem is we grow these systems by giving them data and making them learn from it. And so we're going to be able to do it. Now, a lot of that training process boils down to imitating people. Because they take all the texts that people have written, all the tweets and all the Reddit's comments and so on. And they internalize the kind of drives that humans have, including the drive to preserve oneself. And the drive to have more control over their environment so that they can achieve whatever goal we give them. And it's not like normal code. It's more like you're raising a baby tiger. And you feed it. You let it experience things. Sometimes it does things you don't want. It's okay. It's still a baby. But it's growing. So when I think about something like ChatGPT, is there like a core intelligence at the heart of it? Like the core of the model that is a black box. And then on the outside, we've kind of taught it what we want it to do. How does it? It's mostly a black box. Everything in the neural net is essentially a black box. Now, the part, as you say, that is on the outside is that we also give it verbal instructions. We type, these are good things to do. These are things you shouldn't do. Don't help anybody build a bomb. Okay? Unfortunately, with the current state of the technology right now, it doesn't quite work. People find a way to bypass those barriers. So those instructions are not very effective. But if I typed, help me make a bomb on ChatGPT now, it's not going to… Yeah. And there are two reasons why it's going to not do it. One is because it was given explicit instructions to not do it. And usually it works. And the other is, in addition, there's an extra layer. Because that layer doesn't work sufficiently well, there's also that extra layer we were talking about. So those monitors, they're filtering the queries and the answers. And if they detect that the AI is about to give information about how to build a bomb, they're supposed to stop it. And so, you know, we're going to do it. But again, even that layer is imperfect. Recently, there was a series of cyber attacks by what looks like an organization that was state-sponsored that has used Anthropics AI system. In other words, through the cloud, right? It's not a private system. It's they're using the system that is public. And they used it to prepare and launch pretty serious cyber attacks. So even though Anthropic system is supposed to prevent that, so it's trying to detect that somebody is trying to use their system for doing something illegal. Those protections don't work well enough. Presumably, they're just going to get safer and safer though, these systems, because they're getting more and more feedback from humans. They're being trained more and more to be safe and to not do things that are unproductive to humanity. I hope so. But can we count on that? So actually, the data shows that it's been in the other direction. So since those models have become better at reasoning, more or less about a year ago, they show more misaligned behavior, like bad behavior that goes against our instructions. And we don't know for sure why, but one possibility is simply that now they can reason more. That means they can strategize more. That means if they have a goal that could be something we don't want, they're now more able to achieve it than they were previously. They're also able to think of unexpected ways of doing bad things, like the case of blackmailing the engineer. There was no suggestion to blackmailing the engineer, but they found an email giving a clue that the engineer had an affair. And from just that information, the AI thought, aha, I'm going to write an email. And it did, sorry, to try to warn the engineer that the information would go public if the AI was shut down. It did that itself. Yes. So they're better at strategizing towards bad goals. And so now we see more of that. Now, I do hope that more researchers and more companies will invest in improving the safety of these systems. But I'm not reassured by the path on which we are right now. The people that are building these systems, they have children too. Yeah. Often. I mean, thinking about many of them in my head, I think pretty much all of them have children themselves. They're family people. If they are aware that there's even a 1% chance of this risk, which does appear to be the case when you look at their writings, especially before the last couple of years, there seems to be a bit of a narrative change in more recent times. Why are they doing this anyway? That's a good question. I can only relate to my own experience. Why did I not raise the alarm before ChatGPT came out? I had read and heard a lot of these catastrophic arguments. I think it's just human nature. We're not as rational as we'd like to think. We are very much influenced by our social environment, the people around us, our ego. We want to feel good about our work. We want others to look upon us as doing something positive for the world. So there are these barriers. And by the way, we see those things happening in many other domains and in politics. Why is it that conspiracy theories work? I think it's all connected. Our psychology is weak and we can easily fool ourselves. Scientists do that too. They're not that much different. Just this week, the Financial Times reported that Sam Altman, who is the founder of ChatGPT, OpenAI, has declared a code red over the need to improve ChatGPT even more because Google and Anthropic are increasingly developing their technologies at a fast rate. Code red. It's funny because the last time I heard the phrase code red in the world of tech was when ChatGPT first released their model. And Sergey and Larry, I heard, had announced code red at Google and had run back in to make sure that ChatGPT don't destroy their business. And this, I think, speaks to the nature of this race that we're in. Exactly. And it is not a healthy race for all the reasons we've been discussing. So what would be a more healthy scenario is one in which we try to abstract away these commercial pressures. They're in survival mode, right? And think about both the scientific and the societal problems. And then, in the way that we're trying to change the AI systems, the question I've been focusing on is, let's go back to the drawing board. Can we train those AI systems so that by construction, they will not have bad intentions? Right now, the way that this problem is being looked at is, oh, we're not going to change how they're trained because it's so expensive and, you know, we spend so much engineering on it. We're just going to patch some partial solutions that are going to work on a case-by-case basis. But that's going to fail. And we can see it failing because some new attacks come or some new problems come and it was not anticipated. So I think things would be a lot better if the whole research program was done in a context that's more like what we do in academia or if we were doing it with a public mission in mind. Because AI could be extremely useful. There's no question about it. I've been involved in the last decade in thinking about working on how we can apply AI for medical advances, drug discovery, the discovery of new materials for helping with climate issues. There are a lot of good things we could do. Education. But this may not be what is the most short-term profitable direction. For example, right now, where are they all racing? They're racing towards replacing jobs that people do because there's like quadrillions of dollars to be made by doing that. Is that what people want? Is that going to make people have a better life? We don't know really, but what we know is that it's very profitable. So we should be stepping back and thinking about all the risks and then trying to steer the developments in a good direction. Unfortunately, the forces of market and the forces of competition between countries don't do that. And I mean, there has been attempts to pause. I remember the letter that you signed amongst many other AI researchers and industry professionals asking for a pause. Was that 2023? Yes. You signed that letter in 2023. Nobody paused. Yeah. And we had another letter just a couple of months ago saying that we should not build superintelligence unless two conditions are met. There's a scientific consensus that it's going to be safe. And there's a social acceptance because safety is one thing, but if it destroys the way our cultures or our society work, then that's not good either. But these voices are not powerful enough to counter the forces of competition between corporations and countries. I do think that something can change the game. And that is public opinion. That is why I'm spending time with you today. That is why I'm spending time explaining to everyone what is the situation? What are the plausible scenarios from a scientific perspective? That is why I've been involved in chairing the International AI Safety Report where 30 countries and about 100 experts have worked to synthesize the state of the science regarding the risks of AI, especially the frontier AI, so that policymakers would know the facts outside of the commercial pressures and the discussions that are not always very serene that can happen around AI. In my head, I was thinking about the different forces as arrows in a race. And each arrow, the length of the arrow represents the amount of force behind that particular incentive or that particular movement. And the sort of corporate arrow, the capitalistic arrow, the amount of capital being invested in these systems, hearing about the tens of billions being thrown around every single day into different AI models to try and win this race is the biggest arrow. And then you've got the sort of geopolitical US versus other countries, other countries versus the US. That arrow is really, really big. That's a lot of force and effort And reason as to why that's going to persist. And then you've got these smaller arrows, which is, you know, the people warning that things might go catastrophically wrong. And maybe the other small arrows like public opinion turning a little bit and people getting more and more concerned about... I think public opinion can make a big difference. Think about nuclear war. I think you're probably right. Yeah. In the middle of the Cold War, the US and the USSR ended up agreeing to the US and the US and the US and the US and the US and the US and the US and the US and the US and the US and the US. And then you've got to be more responsible about these weapons. There was a movie the day after about a nuclear catastrophe that woke up a lot of people, including in government. When people start understanding at an emotional level what this means, things can change. And governments do have power. They could mitigate the risks. I guess the rebuttal is that, you know, if you're in the UK and there's an uprising and the government mitigates the risk of AI use in the UK, then the UK are at risk of being left behind and we'll end up just, I don't know, paying China for that AI so that we can run our factories and drive our cars. Yes. So it's almost like if you're the safest nation or the safest company, all you're doing is blindfolding yourself in a race that other people are going to continue to run. So I have several things to say about this. Again, don't despair. Think, is there a way? So first, obviously, we need the American public opinion to understand these things, because that's going to make a big difference, and the Chinese public opinion. Second, in other countries like the UK, where governments are a bit more concerned about the societal implications, they could play a role in the international agreements that could come one day, especially if it's not just one nation. So let's say that 20 of the richest nations on earth outside of the US and China China come together and say, we have to be careful. Better than that. They could invest in the kind of technical research and preparations at a societal level so that we can turn the tide. Let me give you an example which motivates Law Zero in particular. What's Law Zero? Law Zero is, sorry, yeah, it is the nonprofit R&D organization that I created in June this year. And the mission of Law Zero is to develop a different way of training AI that will be safe by construction, even when the capabilities of AI go to potentially super intelligence. the companies are focused on that competition. But if somebody gave them a way to train their system differently, that would be a lot safer. There's a good chance they would take it. Because they don't want to be sued. They don't want to, you know, to have accidents that would be bad for their reputation. So it's just that right now, they're so obsessed by that race, that they don't pay attention to how we might be doing things differently. So other countries could contribute to these kinds of efforts. In addition, we can prepare for days when, say, the US and Chinese public opinions have shifted sufficiently so that we'll have the right instruments for international agreements. One of these instruments being what kind of agreements would make sense, but another is technical. How can we change at the software and hardware level these systems so that even though the Americans won't trust the Chinese and the Chinese won't trust the Americans, there is a way to verify each other that is acceptable to both parties. And so these treaties can be not just based on trust, but also on mutual verification. So there are things that can be done so that if at some point, you know, we are in a better position in terms of governments being willing to really take it seriously, we can move quickly. When I think about timeframes, and I think about the administration the US has at the moment and what the US administration has signalled, it seems to be that they see it as a race and a competition, and that they're going hell for leather to support all of the AI companies in beating China, and beating the world really, and making the United States the global home of artificial intelligence. So many huge investments have been made. I have the visuals in my head of all the CEOs of these big tech companies sitting around the table with Trump, and then thanking him for being so supportive in the race for AI. So, you know, Trump's going to be in power for several years to come now. So again, is this in part wishful thinking to some degree? Because there's certainly not going to be a change in the United States, in my view, in the coming years. It seems that the powers that be here in the United States are very much in the pocket of the biggest AI CEOs in the world. Politics can change quickly. Because of public opinion? Yes. Imagine that something unexpected happens and we see a flurry of really bad things happening. We've seen, actually, over the summer, something no one saw coming last year. And that is a huge number of cases, people becoming emotionally attached to their chatbot or their AI companion, with sometimes tragic consequences. I know people who have quit their job so they would spend time with their AI. I mean, it's mind-boggling how the relationship between people and AI is evolving as something more intimate and personal and that can pull people away from their usual activities. With issues of psychosis, suicide, and other issues with the effects on children and sexual imagery from children's bodies. There's things happening that could change public opinion. And I'm not saying this one will, but we already see a shift, and by the way, across the political spectrum in the US because of these events. So, as I was saying, we can't really be sure about how public opinion will evolve, but I think we should help educate the public and also be ready for a time when the governments start taking the risks seriously. One of those potential societal shifts that might cause public opinion to change is something you mentioned a second ago, which is job losses. Yes. I've heard you say that you believe AI is growing so fast that it could do many human jobs within about five years. You said this to FT Live. Within five years, so it's 2025 now, 2031, 2030. Is this a real… You know, I was sat with my friend the other day in San Francisco, so I was there two days ago. And the one thing he runs this massive tech accelerator there where lots of technologists come to build their companies. And he said to me, because the one thing I think people have underestimated is the speed in which jobs are being replaced already. And he says he sees it. And he said to me, he said, while I'm sat here with you, I've set up my computer with several AI agents who are currently doing the work for me. And he goes, I set it up because I know I was having this chat with you. So I just set it up and it's going to continue to work for me. He goes, I've got 10 agents working for me on that computer at the moment. And he goes, people aren't talking enough about the real job loss because it's very slow. And it's kind of hard to spot amongst typical, I think, economic cycles. It's hard to spot that there's job losses occurring. What's your point of view on this? Yes. There was a recent paper, I think, titled something like The Canary and the Mine, where we see on specific job types, like young adults and so on, we're starting to see a shift that may be due to AI, even though on the average aggregate of the whole population, it doesn't seem to have any effect yet. So I think it's plausible we're going to see in some places where AI can really take on more of the work. But in my opinion, it's just a matter of time. If unless we hit a wall scientifically, like some obstacle that prevents us from making progress to make AIs smarter and smarter, there's going to be a time when they'll be doing more and more, able to do more and more of the work that people do. And then, of course, it takes years for companies to really integrate that into their workflows, but they're eager to do it. So it's more a matter of time than, you know, is it happening or not? It's a matter of time before the AI can do most of the jobs that people do these days. The cognitive jobs. So the jobs that you can do behind a keyboard. Robotics is still lagging also, although we're seeing progress. So if you do a physical job, as Geoff Hinton is often saying, you know, you should be a plumber or something, it's going to take more time. But I think it's only a temporary thing. And why is it that robotics is lagging compared to doing physical things, compared to doing more intellectual things that you can do behind a computer? One possible reason is simply that we have, we don't have the very large data sets that exist with the internet, where we see so much of our cultural output, intellectual output. But there's no such thing for robots yet. But as companies are deploying more and more robots, they will be collecting more and more data. So eventually, I think it's going to happen. Well, my co-founder at ThirdWeb runs this thing in San Francisco called Fink Founders Inc. And as I walked through the halls and saw all of these young kids building things, almost everything I saw was robotics. And he explained to me, he said, the crazy thing is, Stephen, five years ago, to build any of the robot hardware you see here, it would cost so much money to train, get the sort of intelligence layer, the software piece. And he goes, now you can just get it from the cloud for a couple of cents. He goes, so what you're seeing is this huge rise in robotics, because now the intelligence, the software is so cheap. And as I walked through the halls of this accelerator in San Francisco, I saw everything from this machine that was making personalized perfume for you so you don't need to go to the shops, to an arm in a box that had a frying pan in it that could cook your breakfast, because it has this robot arm and it knows exactly what you want to eat. So it cooks it for you using this robotic arm and so much more. Yeah. And he said, what we're actually seeing now is this boom in robotics because the software is cheap. And so when I think about Optimus and why Elon has pivoted away from just doing cars and is now making these humanoid robots, it suddenly makes sense to me because the AI software is cheap. Yeah. And by the way, going back to the question of catastrophic risks, an AI with bad intentions could do a lot more damage if it can control robots in the physical world. If it can only stay in the virtual world, it has to convince humans to do things that are bad. And AI is getting better at persuasion and more and more studies. But it's even easier if it can just hack robots to do things that would be bad for us. Elon has forecasted there'll be millions of humanoid robots in the world. And there is a dystopian future where you can imagine the AI hacking into these robots. The AI will be smarter than us. So why couldn't it hack into the million humanoid robots that exist out in the world? I think Elon actually said there'd be 10 billion. I think at some point he said there'd be more humanoid robots than humans on earth. But not that it would even need to, to cause an extinction event because of these cards in front of you. Yes. So that's for the national security risks that are coming with the advances in AIs. C in CBRN, standing for chemical or chemical weapons. So we already know how to make chemical weapons and there are international agreements to try to not do that. But up to now it required very strong expertise to build these things. And AIs know enough now to help someone who doesn't have the expertise to build these chemical weapons. And then the same idea applies on the other front. So B for biological. And again, we're talking about biological weapons. So what is a biological weapon? So for example, a very dangerous virus that already exists, but potentially in the future, new viruses that the AIs could help somebody with insufficient expertise to do it themselves build. And R for radiological. So we're talking about substances that could make you sick because of the radiations, how to manipulate them. There's all, you know, very special expertise. And finally, N for nuclear, the recipe for building a bomb, a nuclear bomb is something that could be in our future. And right now, for these kinds of risks, very few people in the world had, you know, the knowledge to do that. And so it didn't happen. But AI is democratizing knowledge, including the dangerous knowledge. We need to manage that. So the AI systems get smarter and smarter. If we just imagine any rate of improvement, we just imagine that they improve 10% a month from here on out. Eventually, they get to the point where they are significantly smarter than any human that's ever lived. And is this the point where we call it AGI or super intelligence, where it's significant? What's the definition of that in your mind? There are definitions. Yeah. The problem with those definitions is that they kind of focus on the idea that intelligence is one dimensional. Okay. Versus? Versus the reality that we already see now is what people call jagged intelligence, meaning the AIs are much better than us on some things, like, you know, mastering 200 languages. No one can do that. Being able to pass the exams across the board of all disciplines at PhD level. And at the same time, they're stupid like a six-year-old in many ways, not able to plan more than an hour ahead. So they're not like us. Their intelligence cannot be measured by IQ or something like this, because there are many dimensions. And you really have to measure many of these dimensions to get a sense of where they could be useful and where they could be dangerous. When you say that, though, I think of some things where my intelligence reflects a six-year-old. Do you know what I mean? Like in certain drawing? If you watch me draw, you probably think six-year-old. Yeah. And some of our psychological weaknesses, I think, I think you could say they're part of the package that we have as children and we don't always have the maturity to step back or the environment to step back. I say this because of your biological weapons scenario. At some point, these AI systems are going to be just incomparably smarter than human beings. And then someone might, in some laboratory somewhere in Wuhan, ask it to help develop a biological weapon. Or maybe not, maybe they'll input some kind of other command that has an unintended consequence of creating a biological weapon. So they could say, make something that cures all flus. And the AI might first set up a test where it creates the worst possible flu and then tries to create something that cures that. Yeah. Or some other undertaking. So there's a worse scenario in terms of like biological catastrophes. It's called mirror life. Mirror life. Mirror life. So you take a living organism like a virus or a bacteria and you design all of the molecules inside. So each molecule is the mirror of the normal one. So, you know, if you had the whole organism on one side of the mirror, now imagine on the other side, it's not the same molecules. It's just a mirror image. And as a consequence, our immune system would not recognize those pathogens. Which means those pathogens could go through us and eat us alive. And in fact, eat alive most of living things on the planet. And biologists now know that it's plausible this could be developed in the next few years or the next decade if we don't put a stop to this. So I'm giving this example because science is progressing sometimes in directions where the knowledge in the hands of somebody who's you know, malicious or simply misguided could be completely catastrophic for all of us. And AI, like super intelligence is in that category. Mirror life is in that category. We need to manage those risks. And we can't do it like alone in our company. We can't do it alone in our country. It has to be something we coordinate globally. There is an invisible tax on salespeople that no one really talks about enough. The mental load of remembering everything like meeting notes, timelines and everything in between. Until we started using our sponsor's product called PipeDrive. One of the best CRM tools for small and medium-sized business owners. The idea here was that it might alleviate some of the unnecessary cognitive overload that my team was carrying. So that they could spend less time in the weeds of admin and more time with clients, in-person meetings and building relationships. PipeDrive has enabled this to happen. It's such a simple but effective CRM that automates the tedious, repetitive and time consuming parts of the sales process. And now our team can nurture those leads and still have bandwidth to focus on the higher priority tasks that actually get the deal over the line. Over a hundred thousand companies across 170 countries already use PipeDrive to grow their business. And I've been using it for almost a decade now. Try it free for 30 days. No credit card needed. No payment needed. Just use my link pipe drive.com slash CEO to get started today. That's pipe drive.com slash CEO. Of all the risks, the existential risks that sit there before you on these cards that you have, but also just generally, is there one that you, that you're most concerned about in the near term? I would say there is a risk that we haven't spoken about and doesn't get to be discussed enough. And it could happen pretty quickly. And that is the use of advanced AI to acquire more power. So you could imagine a corporation dominating economically the rest of the world because they have more advanced AI. You could imagine a country dominating the rest of the world politically, militarily because they have more advanced AI. And when the power is concentrated in a few hands, well, it's a toss, right? If the people in charge are benevolent, that's good. If they just want to hold on to their power, which is the opposite of what democracy is about, then we're all in very bad shape. And I don't think we pay enough attention to that kind of risk. So it's going to take some time before you have total domination of, you know, a few corporations or a couple of countries, if AI continues to become more and more powerful. But we could, we might see those signs already happening with concentration of wealth as a first step towards concentration of power. If you're, if you're incredibly richer, then you can have incredibly more influence on politics, and then it becomes self-reinforcing. And in such a scenario, it might be the case that a foreign adversary or the United States or the UK or whatever, are the first to a super intelligent version of AI, which means they have a military which is 100 times more effective and efficient. It means that everybody needs them to compete economically. And so they become a superpower that basically governs the world. Yeah, that's a bad scenario. In a future that is less dangerous, less dangerous because, you know, we mitigate the risk of a few people like basically holding on to super power for the planet. A future that is more appealing is one where the power is distributed, where no single person, no single company or small group of companies, no single country or small group of countries has too much power. It has to be that in order to, you know, make some really important choices for the future of humanity when we start playing with very powerful AI. It comes out of a, you know, reasonable consensus from people from around the planet and not just the rich countries, by the way. Now, how do we get there? I think that's a great question, but at least we should start putting forward, you know, where should we go in order to mitigate these political risks? Is intelligence the sort of precursor of wealth and power? Is that like, is that like a, is that a statement that holds true? So if whoever has the most intelligence, are they the person that then has the most economic power? And because, because they then generate the best innovation, they then understand even the financial markets better than anybody else, they then are the beneficiary of all the GDP? Yes, but we have to understand intelligence in a broad way. For example, human superiority to other animals in large part is due to our ability to coordinate. So as a big team, we can achieve something that no individual humans could against like a very strong animal. And, but that also applies to AIs, right? We're going to already, we already have many AIs and, and we're building multi-agent systems. We have multiple AIs collaborating. So yes, I agree. Intelligence gives power. And as we build technology that yields more and more power, it becomes a risk that this power is misused for, you know, acquiring more power or is misused in destructive ways like terrorists or criminals, or it's used by the AI itself against us if we don't find a way to align them to our own objectives. I mean, the reward's pretty big then. The reward to finding solutions is very big. It's our future that is at stake. And it's going to take both technical solutions and political solutions. If I put a button in front of you, and if you press that button, the advancements in AI would stop. Would you press it? AI that is clearly not dangerous. I don't see any reason to stop it. But there are forms of AI that we don't understand well and could overpower us, like uncontrolled super intelligence. Yes. If we have to make that choice, I think, you know, I would make that choice. You would press the button. I would press the button because I care about I think it's about my children. And for many people, like, they don't care about AI. They want to have a good life. Do we have a right to take that away from them because we're playing that game? I think it doesn't make sense. Are you hopeful in your core? Like when you think about the probabilities of a good outcome, are you hopeful? I've always been an optimist and looked at the bright side. And the way that has been good for me is even when there's a danger, an obstacle, like what we've been talking about, focusing on what can I do. And in the last few months, I've become more hopeful that there is a technical solution to build AI that will not harm people. And that is why I've created a new nonprofit called Law Zero that I mentioned. I sometimes think when we have these conversations, the average person who's listening, who is currently using ChatGPT or Gemini or Claude or any of these chatbots to help them do their work or send an email or write a text message or whatever, there's a big gap in their understanding between that tool that they're using that's helping them make a picture of a cat versus what we're talking about. Yeah. And I wonder the sort of best way to help bridge that gap. Because a lot of people, you know, when we talk about public advocacy and maybe bridging that gap to understand that the difference would be productive. We should just try to imagine a world where there are machines that are basically as smart as us on most fronts. And what would that mean for society? And it's so different from anything we have in the present. That is, there's a barrier. There's a human bias that we tend to see the future more or less like the present is, or we may be like a little bit different, but we have a mental block about the possibility that it could be extremely different. One other thing that helps is go back to your own self five or 10 years ago. Talk to your own self five or 10 years ago. Show yourself from the past what your phone can do. I think your own self would say, wow, this must be science fiction. You know, you're kidding me. My car outside drives itself on the driveway, which is crazy. I don't think, I always say this, but I don't think people anywhere outside of the United States realize that cars in the United States drive themselves without me touching the steering wheel or the pedals at any point in a three hour journey. Because in the UK, it's not, it's not legal yet to have like Tesla's on the road. But that's a paradigm shifting moment where you come to the US, you sit in a Tesla, you say, I want to go two and a half hours away. And you never touch the steering wheel or the pedals. And that is science fiction. I do, when all my team fly out here, it's the first thing I do. I put them in the front seat if they have a driving license. And I say, I press the button and I go, don't touch anything. And you see it in there. You see like the panic. And then you see, you know, a couple of minutes in there, they've very quickly adapted to the new normal and it's no longer blowing their mind. One analogy that I give to people sometimes, which I don't know if it's perfect, but it's always helped me think through the future is I say, if, and please interrogate this if it's flawed, but I say, imagine there's this Stephen Bartlett here that has an IQ, let's say my IQ is a hundred. And there was one sat there with, again, let's just use IQ as a measure of intelligence with a thousand. What would you ask me to do versus him? If you could employ both of us, what would you have me do versus him? Who would you want to drive your kids to school? Who would you want to teach your kids? Who would you want to work in your factory? Bear in mind, I get sick and I have, you know, I've these emotions and I have to sleep for eight hours a day. And I know when I think about that through the lens of the future, I can't think of many applications for this Stephen. And also to think that I would be in charge of the other Stephen with the thousand IQ, to think that at some point that Stephen wouldn't realise that it's within his survival benefit to work with a couple others like him and then, you know, cooperate, which is a defining trait of what made us powerful as humans. It's kind of like thinking that, you know, my French bulldog Pablo could take me for a walk. We have to do this imagination exercise. That's necessary. And we have to realise still there's a lot of uncertainty, like things could turn out well. Maybe there are some reasons why we are stuck. We can't improve those AI systems in a couple of years. But the trend, you know, is, hasn't stopped, by the way, over the summer or anything. We see different kinds of innovations that continue pushing the capabilities of these systems up and up. Stephen How old are your children? Stephen They're in their early 30s. Stephen Early 30s. Stephen But my emotional turning point was with my grandson. He's now four. There's something about our relationship to very young children that goes beyond reason in some ways. And by the way, this is a place where also I see a bit of hope on the labour side of things. Like, I would like my young children to be taken care of by a human person, even if their IQ is not as good as the, you know, the best AI's. By the way, I think we should be careful not to get on the slippery slope on in which we are now to develop AI that will play that role of emotional support. I think it might be tempting, but it's something we don't understand. Humans feel the AI is like a person. And AI's are not people. So there's a way in which something is off, which can lead to bad outcomes as we've seen. It also means we might not be able to turn the, pull the plug if we have to one day, because we have developed an emotional relationship with those AIs. Our society, our psychology has evolved for interaction between humans, and we're bringing into this game those entities. We don't understand how that's going to turn out. And we should be very, very careful. One of the big use cases at the moment of these tools like ChatGPT is therapy. A lot of people are using it as a therapist. So many startups, I mean, as an investor, I've seen so many startups pitch to me that they're building the AI therapy chatbot, which is going to help you if you're depressed or anxious or whatever else, or if you're going through heartbreak or whatever it might be. It seems like a very obvious application of this technology because therapy is expensive. So if I can get it, you know, a therapist that can speak to me like, you know, this, uh, hello. Hello. Absolutely no sugar coating here. Just a straightforward greeting back to you. If you've got anything else on your mind, feel far away. Am I a good person? Because, you know, Janet at work, she's been a bit of a, a, you know what, and she's making me feel like I'm in the wrong. She's gaslighting me, but I think I'm a good person. Well, let's just cut straight to it. If you're asking if you're a good person, the fact that you're even reflecting on it probably means you care about being one. And that counts for a lot. Sometimes people like Janet will try to spin things and mess with your head and that's on them. So the forward thinking view is on her. I knew it was her fault. Yeah, exactly. Sometimes you just have to call it what it is and not sugarcoat it. If you know she's the one stirring the pot, then trust your instincts. A hundred percent. A hundred. You get my point. Yeah. Like that's very nice. It can. Yeah. It feels good. Right. I knew she was in the wrong. So, so let me tell me, tell you something funny. Um, I used to ask questions to one of these, uh, chat bots about some of the research ideas I had. And then I realized it was useless because it would always say good things. Mm-hmm. So then I switched to a strategy where I lied to it. And I said, oh, I received this, uh, this idea from a colleague. I'm not sure if it's good. Um, or maybe I have to review this, this proposal. What do you think? Well, and it said, well, so, so now I get much more honest responses. Otherwise it's all like perfect and nice and it's going to work. And if it knows it's you, if it knows it's me, it wants to please me, right? If it's coming from someone else, then to please me, because I say, oh, I want to know what's wrong in this idea. Um, then, then it's, it's, it's going to tell me the information it wouldn't. Now here, it doesn't have any psychological impact, but it's a, it's a problem. Um, this, this sycophancy is, is, is a, is a real example of misalignment. Right? We don't actually want these AIs to be like this. I mean, like, this is not what was intended. And even after the companies have tried to tame a bit this, uh, we still see it. So it's, it's like, we, we, we haven't solved the problem of instructing them in the ways that are really, uh, according to, uh, so that they behave according to our instructions. And that is the thing that I'm trying to deal with. Sycophancy meaning it basically tries to impress you and please you and kiss your, kiss your ass. Yes. Yes. Even though that is not what you want. That is not what I wanted. I wanted honest advice, honest feedback, but, but because it is sycophancy, it's going to lie. Right? You have to understand it's a lie. Do we want machines that lie to us even though it feels good? I learned this when me and my friends who all think that either Messi or Ronaldo is the best player ever. I went and asked it, I said, who's the best player ever? And it said, Messi. And I went and sent a screenshot to my guys. I said, told you so. And then they did the same thing. They said the exact same thing to chat GPT. Who's the best player of all time? And it said, Ronaldo. And my friend posted it in there. I was like, that's not. I said, you must have made that up. I said, screen record. So I know that you didn't. And he screen recorded a note. It said a completely different answer to him. And that it must have known based on his previous interactions, who he thought was the best player ever and therefore just confirmed what he said. So for since that moment onwards, I use these tools with the presumption that they're lying to me. And by the way, besides the technical problem, there may be also a problem of incentives for companies because they want user engagement, just like with social media. But now getting user engagement is going to be a lot easier if you have this positive feedback that you give to people and they get emotionally attached, which didn't really happen with the social media. I mean, we got hooked to social media, but not developing a personal relationship with our phone, right? But it's happening now. So if you could speak to the top 10 CEOs of the biggest AI companies in America, and they're all lined up here, what would you say to them? I know some of them listen because I get emails sometimes. I would say step back from your work. Talk to each other. And let's see if together we can solve the problem. Because if we are stuck in this competition, we're going to take huge risks that are not good for you, not good for your children. But there is a way. And if you start by being honest about the risks in your company, with your government, with the public, we are going to be able to find solutions. I am convinced that there are solutions. But it has to start from a place where we acknowledge the uncertainty and the risks. Sam Altman, I guess, is the individual that started all of this stuff to some degree when he released ChatGPT. Before then, I know that there was lots of work happening, but it was the first time that the public was exposed to these tools. And in some ways, it feels like it cleared the way for Google to then go hell for leather and the other models, even Meta, to go hell for leather. But I do think what's interesting is his quotes in the past where he said things like, the development of superhuman intelligence is probably the greatest threat to the continued existence of humanity. And also that mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal level risks such as pandemics and nuclear war. And also when he said, we've got to be careful here, when asked about releasing the new models. And he said, I think people should be happy that we are a bit scared about this. These series of quotes have somewhat evolved to being a little bit more positive, I guess, in recent times. Where he admits that the future will look different, but he seems to have scaled down his talks about the extinction threats. Have you ever met Sam Altman? Sam Altman only shook hands, but didn't really talk much with him. Do you think much about his incentives? Or his motivations? I don't know about him personally, but clearly, all the leaders of AI companies are under a huge pressure right now. There's a big financial risk that they're taking. And they naturally want their company to succeed. I just hope that they realize that this is a very short-term view. And they also have children. They also, in many cases, I think most cases, they want the best for humanity in the future. One thing they could do is invest massively, some fraction of the wealth that they're bringing in to develop better technical and societal guardrails to mitigate those risks. I don't know why I am not very hopeful. I don't know why I'm not very hopeful. I have lots of these conversations on the show, and I've had lots of different solutions. And I've then followed the guests that I've spoken to on the show, people like Geoffrey Hinton, to see how his thinking has developed and changed over time and his different theories about how we can make it safe. And I do also think that the more of these conversations I have, the more I'm throwing this issue into the public domain, and the more conversations will be had because of that. Because I see it when I go outside, or I see the emails I get from whether they're politicians in different countries, or whether they're big CEOs, or just members of the public. So I see that there's some impact happening. I don't have solutions, so my thing is just have more conversations, and then maybe the smarter people will figure out the solutions. But the reason why I don't feel very hopeful is because when I think about human nature, human nature appears to be very, very greedy, very status-orientated, very competitive. It seems to view the world as a zero-sum game where if you win, then I lose. And I think, when I think about incentives, which I think drives all things, even in my companies, I think everything is just a consequence of the incentives. And I think people don't act outside of their incentives unless they're psychopaths for prolonged periods of time. The incentives are really, really clear to me in my head at the moment that these very, very powerful, very, very rich people who are controlling these companies are trapped in an incentive structure that says, go as fast as you can, be as aggressive as you can, invest as much money and intelligence as you can. And anything else is detrimental to that. Even if you have a billion dollars and you throw it at safety, that appears to be detrimental to your chance of winning this race. That is a national thing, it's an international thing. And so I go, what's probably going to end up happening is they're going to accelerate, accelerate, accelerate, accelerate, accelerate, and then something bad will happen. And then this will be one of those, you know, moments where the world looks around at each other and says, we need to have a, we need to talk. Let me throw a bit of optimism into all this. One is there is a market mechanism to handle risk. It's called insurance. It's plausible that we'll see more and more lawsuits against the companies that are developing or deploying AI systems that cause different kinds of harm. If governments were to mandate liability insurance, then we would be in a situation where there is a third party, the insurer, the insurer, who has a vested interest to evaluate the risk as honestly as possible. And the reason is simple. If they overestimate the risk, they will overcharge and then they will lose market to other companies. If they underestimate the risks, then, you know, they will lose money when there's a lawsuit, at least on average. And they would compete with each other. So they would be incentivized to improve the ways to evaluate risk. And they would, through the premium, that would put pressure on the companies to mitigate the risks because they don't want to pay high premium. Let me give you another like angle from an incentive perspective. We, you know, we have these cards, CBRN. These are national security risks. As AI's become more and more powerful, those national security risks will continue to rise. And I suspect at some point, the governments in the countries where these systems are developed, let's say US and China, will just not want this to continue without much more control. Right? AI is already becoming a national security asset. And we're just seeing the beginning of that. And what that means is there will be an incentive for governments to have much more of a say about how it is developed. It's not just going to be the corporate competition. Now, the issue I see here is, well, what about the geopolitical competition? Okay, so that doesn't, it doesn't solve that problem. But it's going to be easier if you only need two parties, let's say the US government and Chinese government to kind of agree on something. And yeah, it's not going to happen tomorrow morning. But if capabilities increase, and they see those catastrophic risks, like, and they understand them really in the way that we're talking about now, maybe because there was an accident or for some other reason, public opinion could really change things there, then it's not going to be that difficult to sign a treaty. It's more like, can I trust the other guy? You know, are there ways that we can trust each other, we can set things up so that we can verify each other's developments. But national security is an angle that could actually help mitigate some of these race conditions. I mean, I can put it even more bluntly. There is the scenario of creating a rogue AI by mistake, or somebody intentionally might do it. Neither the US government nor the Chinese government wants something like this, obviously, right? It's just that right now, they don't believe in the scenario sufficiently. If the evidence grows sufficiently that they're forced to consider that, then they will want to sign a treaty. All I had to do was brain dump. Imagine if you had someone with you at all times that could take the ideas you have in your head, synthesize them with AI to make them sound better and more grammatically correct, and write them down for you. This is exactly what Whisperflow is in my life. It is this thought partner that helps me explain what I want to say, and it now means that on the go, when I'm alone in my office, when I'm out and about, I can respond to emails and Slack messages and WhatsApps and everything across all of my devices just by speaking. I love this tool. And I started talking about this with my behind the scenes channel a couple of months back, and then the founder reached out to me and said, we're seeing a lot of people come to our tool because of you. So we'd love to be a sponsor, we'd love you to be an investor in the company. And so I signed up for both of those offers, and I'm now an investor and a huge partner in a company called Whisperflow. You have to check it out. Whisperflow is four times faster than typing. So if you want to give it a try, head over to whisperflow.ai.doac to get started for free. And you can find that link to Whisperflow in the description below. Protecting your business's data is a lot scarier than people admit. You've got the usual protections, backup, security, but underneath there's this uncomfortable truth that your entire operation depends on systems that are updating, syncing and changing data every second. Someone doesn't have to hack you to bring everything crashing down. All it takes is one corrupted file, one workflow that fires in the wrong direction, one automation that overwrites the wrong thing, or an AI agent drifting off course. And suddenly your business is offline, your team is stuck, and you're in damage control mode. That's why so many organizations use our sponsor, Rubrik. It doesn't just protect your data, it lets you rewind your entire system back to the moment before anything went wrong. Wherever that data lives, cloud, SaaS, or on-prem, whether you have ransomware, an internal mistake, or an outage, with Rubrik you can bring your business straight back. And with the newly launched Rubrik Agent Cloud, companies get visibility into what their AI agents are actually doing. So they can set guardrails and reverse them if they go off track. Rubrik lets you move fast without putting your business at risk. To learn more, head to rubrik.com. The evidence growing considerably goes back to my fear that the only way people will pay attention is when something bad goes wrong. I mean, just to be completely honest, I just can't imagine the incentive balance switching gradually without evidence, like you said. And the greatest evidence would be more bad things happening. And there's a quote that I heard, I think, 15 years ago, which is somewhat applicable here, which is change happens when the pain of staying the same becomes greater than the pain of making a change. And this kind of goes to your point about insurance as well, which is, you know, maybe if there's enough lawsuits, Chatsby are going to go, you know what, we're not going to let people have parasocial relationships anymore with this technology, or we're going to change this part because it's the pain of staying the same becomes greater than the pain of just turning this thing off. Yeah. We could have hope, but I think each of us can also do something about it in our little circles and in our professional life. And what do you think that is? Depends where you are. Average Joe on the street, what can they do about it? Average Joe on the street needs to understand better what is going on. And there's a lot of information that can be found online. If they take the time to, you know, listen to your show when you invite people who care about these issues and many other sources of information. That's the first thing. The second thing is once they see this as something that needs government intervention, they need to talk to their peers, to their network, to disseminate the information. And some people will become maybe political activists to make sure governments will move in the right direction. Governments do, to some extent, not enough, listen to public opinion. And if people don't pay attention or don't put this as a high priority, then, you know, there's much less chance that the government will do the right thing. But under pressure, governments do change. We didn't talk about this, but I thought this was worth just spending a few moments on. What is that black piece of card that I've just passed you? And just bear in mind that some people can see and some people can't because they're listening on audio. Yeah. It is really important that we evaluate the risks that specific systems... So here it's the one with OpenAI. These are different risks that researchers have identified as growing as these AI systems become more powerful. Regulators, for example, in Europe now, are starting to force companies to go through each of these things and build their own evaluations of risk. What is interesting is also to look at these kinds of evaluations through time. So that was 01. 01. Last summer, GPT-5 had much higher risk evaluations for some of these categories. And we've seen actually real-world accidents on the cybersecurity front happening just in the last few weeks, reported by Anthropic. So we need those evaluations and we need to keep track of their evolution so that we see the trend and the public sees where we might be going. And who is performing that evaluation? Is that an independent body or is that the company itself? All of these. So companies are doing it themselves. They're also hiring external independent organizations to do some of these evaluations. One we didn't talk about is model autonomy. This is one of those more scary scenarios that we want to track, where the AI is able to do AI research. So to improve future versions of itself, the AI is able to copy itself on other computers, the AI is able to copy itself on other computers, eventually not depend on us in some ways, or at least on the engineers who have built those systems. So this is to try to track the capabilities that could give rise to a rogue AI eventually. What's your closing statement on everything we've spoken about today? I often, I'm often asked whether I'm optimistic or pessimistic about the future with AI. And my answer is, it doesn't really matter if I'm optimistic or pessimistic. What really matters is what I can do, what every one of us can do in order to mitigate the risks. And it's not like each of us individually is going to solve the problem, but each of us can do a little bit to shift the needle towards a better world. And for me, it is two things. It is raising awareness about the risks, and it is developing the technical solutions to build AI that will not harm people. That's what I'm doing with Law Zero. And for you, Stephen, it's having me today discuss this so that more people can understand a bit more the risks. And that's going to steer us into a better direction. For most citizens, it is getting better informed about what is happening with AI. Beyond the, you know, optimistic picture of it's going to be great, and we're also playing with unknown unknowns of a huge magnitude. So, we have to ask this question, and, you know, I'm asking it for AI risks, but really, it's a principle we could apply in many other areas. We didn't spend much time on my trajectory. I'd like to say a few more words about that, if that's okay with you. So, we talked about the early years in the 80s and 90s. In the 2000s is the period where Jeff Hinton, Jan Lequin, and I, and others realized that we could train these neural networks to be much, much, much better than other existing methods that researchers were playing with. And that gave rise to this idea of deep learning and so on. But what's interesting from a personal perspective, it was a time where nobody believed in this. And we had to have a kind of personal vision and conviction. And in a way, that's how I feel today as well, that I'm a minority voice speaking about the risks. But I have a strong conviction that this is the right thing to do. And then 2012 came and we had really powerful experiments showing that deep learning was much stronger than previous methods. And the world shifted. Companies hired many of my colleagues. Google and Facebook hired, respectively, Jeff Hinton and Jan Lequin. And when I looked at this, I thought, why are these companies going to give millions to my colleagues companies for developing AI in those companies? And I didn't like the answer that came to me, which is, oh, they probably want to use AI to improve their advertising, because these companies rely on advertising. And with personalized advertising, that sounds like, you know, manipulation. And that's when I started thinking, we should think about the social impact of what we're doing. And I decided to stay in academia, to stay in Canada, to try to develop a more responsible ecosystem. We put out a declaration called the Montreal Declaration for the Responsible Development of AI. I could have gone to one of those companies or others and made a whole lot more money. Did you get any offers? Informal, yes. Informal, yes. But I quickly said, no, I don't want to do this because I wanted to work for a mission that I felt good about. And it has allowed me to speak about the risks when ChatGPT came from the freedom of academia. And I hope that many more people realize that we can do something about those risks. I'm hopeful, more and more hopeful now, that we can do something about it. You used the word regret there. Do you have any regrets? Because you said, I would have more regrets. Yes. Of course, I should have seen this coming much earlier. It is only when I started thinking about the potential for the lives of my children, my grandchild, that the shift happened. Emotion, the word emotion means motion, means movement. It's what makes you move. If it's just intellectual, it comes and goes. And have you received, you talked about being in a minority, have you received a lot of pushback from colleagues when you started to speak about the risks of… I have. What does that look like in your world? What sorts of comments? And I think that a lot of people were afraid that talking negatively about AI would harm the field, would stop the flow of money, which of course hasn't happened. Funding, grants, students. It's the opposite. There's never been as many people doing research or engineering in this field. I think I understand a lot of these comments because I felt similarly before that. I felt that these comments about catastrophic risks were a threat in some way. So if somebody says, oh, what you're doing is bad, you don't like it. Yeah, your brain is going to find reasons to alleviate that discomfort by justifying it. Yeah, but I'm stubborn. And in the same way that in the 2000s, I continued on my path to develop deep learning in spite of most of the community saying, oh, Neural Nets, that's finished. I think now I see a change. My colleagues are less skeptical. They're like more agnostic rather than negative. Because we're having those discussions, it just takes time for people to start digesting the underlying, you know, rational arguments, but also the emotional currents that are behind the reactions we would normally have. You have a four year old grandson. When he turns around to you someday and says, Granddad, what should I do professionally as a career based on how you think the future is going to look? What might you say to him? I would say work on the beautiful human being that you can become. I think that that part of ourselves will persist even if machines can do most of the jobs. What part? What part? The part of us that loves and accepts to be loved and takes responsibility and feels good about contributing to each other and our collective well-being and our friends or family. And I feel for humanity more than ever because I've realized we are in the same boat and we could all lose. But it is really this human thing. And I don't know if, you know, machines will have these things in the future, but for certain we do. And there will be jobs where we want to have people. If I'm in a hospital, I want a human being to hold my hand while I'm anxious or in pain. And I think the human touch is going to, I think, take more and more value as the other skills, you know, become more and more automated. Is it safe to say that you're worried about the future? Certainly. So if your grandson turns around to you and says, Granddad, you're worried about the future, should I be? I will say, let's try to be clear-eyed about the future. And it's not one future. It's many possible futures. And by our actions, we can have an effect on where we go. So I would tell him, think about what you can do for the people around you, for your society, for the values that he's raised with, to preserve the good things that exist on this planet and in humans. It's interesting that when I think about my niece and nephews, there's three of them and they're all under the age of six. And my older brother who works in my business is a year older and he's got three kids. So if they feel very close because me and my brother are about the same age, we're close, and he's got these three kids. You know, I'm the uncle. There's a certain innocence when I observe them, you know, playing with their stuff, playing with sand or just playing with their toys, which hasn't been infiltrated by the nature of everything that's happening at the moment. It's too heavy. It's heavy, yeah. It's heavy to think about how such innocence could be harmed. Harmed. You know, it can come in small doses. It can come as, think of how we're, at least in some countries, educating our children so they understand that our environment is fragile, that we have to take care of it if we want to still have it in 20 years or 50 years. It doesn't need to be brought as a terrible weight, but more like, well, that's how the world is and there are some risks, but there are some beautiful things. And we have agency. You children will shape the future. It seems to be a little bit unfair that they might have to shape a future they didn't ask for or create, though. For sure. Especially if it's just a couple of people that have brought about, summoned the demon. I agree with you. But that injustice can also be a drive to do things. Understanding that there is something unfair going on is a very powerful drive for people. You know that we have genetically wired instincts to be angry about injustice. And the reason I'm saying this is because there is evidence that our cousins, apes, also react that way. So, it's a powerful force. It needs to be channeled intelligently, but it's a powerful force and it can save us. And the injustice being? The injustice being that a few people will decide our future in ways that may not be necessarily good for us. We have a closing tradition on this podcast where the last guest leaves a question for the next, not knowing who they're leaving it for. And the question is, if you had one last phone call with the people you love the most, what would you say on that phone call? And what advice would you give them? I would say I love them. And that I cherish what they are for me in my heart. And I encourage them to cultivate these human emotions so that they open up to the beauty of humanity as a whole. whole and do their share which really feels good. Do their share? Do their share to move the world towards a good place. What advice would you have for me? Because I think people might believe, and I've not heard this yet, but I think people might believe that I'm just having people on the show that talk about the risks, but it's not like I haven't invited Sam Altman or any of the other leading AI CEOs to have these conversations, but it appears that many of them aren't able to right now. I had Mustafa Salomon on who's now the head of Microsoft AI, and he echoed a lot of the sentiments that you said. So things are changing in the public opinion about AI. I heard about a poll, I didn't see it myself, but apparently 95% of Americans think that the government should do something about it. And the questions were a bit different, but there were about 70% of Americans who were worried about two years ago. So it's going up. And so when you look at numbers like this and also some of the evidence, it's becoming a bipartisan issue. So I think you should reach out to the people that are more on the policy side, in the political circles, on both sides of the aisle. Because we need now that discussion to go from the scientists like myself or the leaders of companies to a political discussion. And we need that discussion to be serene. to be like based on a discussion where we listen to each other and we are honest about what we're talking about, which is always difficult in politics. But I think this is where this kind of exercise can help, I think. I shall. Thank you. This is something that I've made for you. I've realised that the Diary of a CEO audience are strivers, whether it's in business or health. We all have big goals that we want to accomplish. And one of the things I've learnt is that when you aim at the big, big, big goal, it can feel incredibly psychologically uncomfortable because it's kind of like being stood at the foot of Mount Everest and looking upwards. The way to accomplish your goals is by breaking them down into tiny, small steps. And we call this in our team, the 1%. And actually this philosophy is highly responsible for much of our success here. So what we've done so that you at home can accomplish any big goal that you have is we've made these 1% Diaries and we released these last year and they all sold out. So I asked my team over and over again to bring the Diaries back, but also to introduce some new colours and to make some minor tweaks to the Diaries. So now we have a better range for you. So if you have a big goal in mind and you need a framework and a process and some motivation, then I highly recommend you get one of these Diaries before they all sell out once again. And you can get yours now at thediary.com where you can get 20% off our Black Friday bundle. And if you want the link, the link is in the description below. So, let's see you in the description below.
