I watched my agent happily click the I'm not a robot button. I made the agent very aware. Like it knows what its source code is. It understands how it sits and runs in its own harness. It knows where the documentation is. It knows which model it runs. It understands its own system that made it very easy for an agent to, oh, you don't like anything, you just prompted it to exist. And then the agent would just modify its own software. People talk about self-modifying software. I just built it. I actually think vibe coding is a slur. You prefer agentic engineering. Yeah, I always tell people I do agentic engineering and then maybe after 3 a.m. I switch to vibe coding and then have regrets on the next day. What a walk of shame. You just have to clean up and like fix your shit. We've all been there. I used to write really long prompts. And by writing, I mean, I don't write, I talk. These hands are like too precious for writing now. I just use bespoke prompts to build my software. So you for real, with all those terminals, are using voice? Yeah. I used to do it very extensively to the point where there was a period where I lost my voice. I mean, I have to ask you, just curious. I know you've probably gotten huge offers from major companies. Can you speak to who you're considering working with? Yeah. The following is a conversation with Peter Steinberger, creator of OpenClaw. Formerly known as Moldbot, Claudebot, Claudus, Claude, spelled with a W, as in Lobster Claw. Not to be confused with Claude, the AI model from Anthropic, spelled with a U. In fact, this confusion is the reason Anthropic kindly asked Peter to change the name to OpenClaw. So, what is OpenClaw? It's an open source AI agent that has taken over the tech world in a matter of days, exploding in popularity, reaching over 180,000 stars on GitHub, and spawning the social network Moldbook, where AI agents post manifestos and debate consciousness, creating a mix of excitement and fear in the general public, in a kind of AI psychosis, a mix of clickbait, fear-mongering, and genuine, fully justifiable concern about the role of AI in our digital, interconnected human world. OpenClaw, as its tagline states, is the AI that actually does things. It's an autonomous AI assistant that lives on your computer, has access to all of your stuff if you let it, talks to you through Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal, iMessage, and whatever else messaging client, uses whatever AI model you like, including Claude Opus 4.6 and GPT 5.3 codecs, all to do stuff for you. Many people are calling this one of the biggest moments in the recent history of AI since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022. The ingredients for this kind of AI agent were all there, but putting it all together in a system that definitively takes a step forward over the line from language to agency, from ideas to actions, in a way that created a useful assistant that feels like one who gets you and learns from you, in an open-source community-driven way, is the reason OpenClaw took the internet by storm. Its power, in large part, comes from the fact that you can give it access to all of your stuff and give it permission to do anything with that stuff in order to be useful to you. This is very powerful, but it is also dangerous. OpenClaw represents freedom, but with freedom comes responsibility. With it, you can own and have control over your data, but precisely because you have this control, you also have the responsibility to protect it from cybersecurity threats of various kinds. There are great ways to protect yourself, but the threats and vulnerabilities are out there. Again, a powerful AI agent with system-level access is a security minefield, but it also represents the future, because when done well and securely, it can be extremely useful to each of us humans as a personal assistant. We discuss all of this with Peter, and also discuss his big-picture programming and entrepreneurship life story, which I think is truly inspiring. He spent 13 years building PSPDFKit, which is a software used on a billion devices. He sold it, and for a brief time, fell out of love with programming, vanished for three years, and then came back, rediscovered his love for programming, and built in a very short time an open-source AI agent that took the internet by storm. He is, in many ways, the symbol of the AI revolution happening in the programming world. There was the Chagipiti moment in 2022, the DeepSeek moment in 2025, and now, in 26, we're living through the open-claw moment, the age of the lobster, the start of the agentic AI revolution. What a time to be alive. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description, where you can also find links to contact me, ask questions, give feedback, and so on. And now, dear friends, here's Peter Steinberger. The one and only, the Claude father. Actually, Benjamin predicted in this tweet, the following is a conversation with Claude, a respected crustacean. It's a hilarious-looking picture of a lobster in a suit. So, I think the prophecy has been fulfilled. Let's go to this moment when you built a prototype in one hour. That was the early version of OpenClaw. I think this story is really inspiring to a lot of people, because this prototype led to something that just took the internet by storm and became the fastest-growing repository in GitHub history, with now over 175,000 stars. So, what was the story of the one-hour prototype? You know, I wanted that since April. A personal assistant. AI personal assistant. Yeah, and I played around with some other things, like even stuff that gets all my WhatsApp, and I could just run queries on it. That was back when we had GPT 4.1, with the one million context window, and I pulled in all the data and asked them questions like, what makes this friendship meaningful? And I got some really profound results. Like, I sent it to my friends, and they got, like, teary eyes. So, there's something there. Yeah. But then I thought all the labs will work on that. So, I moved on to other things, and that was still very much in my early days of experimenting and playing. You know, you have to... That's how you learn. You just, like, you do stuff, and you play. And time flew by, and it was November. I wanted to make sure that the thing I started is actually happening. I was annoyed that it didn't exist, so I just prompted it into existence. I mean, that's the beginning of the hero's journey of the entrepreneur, right? And you've, even with your original story with PSPDF kit, it's like, why does this not exist? Let me build it. And again, here's a whole different realm, but similar maybe spirit. Yes, I had this problem. I tried to show PDF on an iPad, which should not be hard. This is like 15 years ago, something like that. Yeah. Like, the most random thing ever. And suddenly, I had this problem, and I wanted to help a friend. And there was, there was, well, not, like, nothing existed, but it was just not good. I'm like, like, I tried it, and it was, like, very, meh. I'm like, I can do this better. By the way, for people who don't know, this led to the development of PSPDF kit that's used on a billion devices. So, it turns out that it's pretty useful to be able to open a PDF. You could also make the joke that I'm really bad at naming. Like, name them the five on the current project, and even PSPDF doesn't really roll from the tongue. Anyway, so you said, screw it, why don't I do it? So, what was the prototype? What was the thing that you, what was the magical thing that you built in a short amount of time that you're like, this might actually work as an agent, or I talk to it and it does things? There was, like, one of my projects before already did something where I could bring my terminals onto the web, and then I could, like, interact with them, but there also would be terminals on my Mac. Vibe Tunnel, which was, like, a weekend hack project that was still very early, and, it was cloud code times. You know, you got a dopamine hit when you got something right, and now I get, like, mad when you get something wrong. And you had a really great, not to take a tangent, but a great blog post describing that you converted Vibe Tunnel. You Vibe Coded Vibe Tunnel from TypeScript into Zig of all programming languages with a single prompt. One prompt, one shot, convert the entire code base into Zig. Yeah. There was this one thing where part of the architecture was, took too much memory. Every terminal used, like, a node, and I wanted to change it to Rust, and, I mean, I can do it. I can manually figure it all out, but all my automated attempts failed miserably. And then I revisited, about four or five months later, and I'm like, okay, now let's use something even more experimental. And I, and I just typed convert this and this part to Zig, and then let codex run off. And it basically got it right. There was one little detail that I had to, like, modify afterwards, but it just ran for overnight, like six hours, and just did the thing. And it's like, it's just mind-blowing. So that's on the LLM programming side, refactoring, but back to the actual story of the, of the prototype. So how did Vytonnel connect to the first prototype where you're like, agents can actually work? Well, that was still very limited. You know, like, I had this one experiment with WhatsApp, then I had this experiment, and both felt like not the right answer. And then I my search, I was literally just hooking up WhatsApp to Cloud Code, one shot, the CLI, message comes in, I call the CLI with minus P, it does its magic, I get the string back, and I send it back to WhatsApp, and I, I built this in one hour, and I felt, already felt really cool. It's like, oh, I could, I can, like, talk to my computer, right? this, that was cool. But I wanted images, because I often use images when I prompt, I think it's such a, such an efficient way to give the agent more context, and they're really good at figuring out what I mean, even if it's like a, a weird crop top screenshot. So I used it a lot, and I wanted to do it in WhatsApp as well. Also, like, you know, just, you run around, you see like, a poster of an event, and just make a screenshot, and like, figure out if I have time there, if this is good, if my friends are maybe up for that. It's like, images seemed important. So I, I worked a few, it took me a few more hours to actually get that right. And then it was just, I, I used it a lot. And funny enough, that was just before I went on a trip to Marrakesh with my friends for a birthday trip. And there it was even better, because internet was a little shaky, but WhatsApp just works, you know, it's like, it doesn't matter, you have like, edge, it still works. WhatsApp is just, it's just made really well. So I ended up using it a lot. Translate is for me, explain is, find me places, like, you're just having a clanker doing, having Google for you. That was, basically, it was still nothing built, but it still could do so much. So, if we talk about the full journey that's happening there with the agent, you're just sending on this very thin line, WhatsApp message via CLI is going to Cloud Code, and Cloud Code is doing all kinds of heavy work, and coming back to you with a thin message. Yeah, it was slow, because every time I boot up the CLI, but it, it was really cool already. and it could just use all the things that I already had built, and I put, like, a whole bunch of CLI stuff over the months, so it, it felt really powerful. There is something magical about that experience that's hard to put into words, being able to use a chat client to talk to an agent, versus, like, sitting behind a computer and, like, I don't know, using Courser, or even using Cloud Code CLI in the terminal. It's a different experience than being able to sit back and talk to it. I mean, it seems like a trivial step, but it's, in some, in some sense, it's, it's like a phase shift in the integration of AI into your life, how it feels, right? Yeah, yeah, I, I read this tweet this morning where someone said, oh, there's no magic in it, it's just, like, it does this and this and this and this and this and this and this, and it, it almost feels like a hobby just as Curse or Perplexity. And I'm like, well, if that's a hobby, that's kind of a compliment, you know? They're like, they're not doing too bad? Um, thank you, I guess? Yes, I mean, isn't, isn't, isn't magic often just, like, you take a lot of things that are already there, but bring them together in new ways? Like, I don't, there's no, yeah, maybe there's no magic in there, but sometimes just rearranging things and, like, adding a few new ideas is all the magic that you need. Yeah, it's really hard to convert into words what is, what is magic about a thing? If you look at the, the scrolling on an iPhone, why is that so pleasant? There's a lot of elements about that interface that makes it incredibly pleasant, that is fundamental to the experience of using a smartphone. And it's like, okay, all the components were there, scrolling was there, everything was there. Nobody did it. Yep. And afterwards, it felt so obvious. That's so obvious. Right? Yeah. Still, um, no, the moment where it, it blew my mind was when, when I used it a lot and at some point I just sent it a message and, and then a typing indicator appeared and, and I'm like, wait, I didn't build that. Uh, it's only, it only has image support. So what is it even doing? And then it would just reply. What was the thing you sent it? Oh, just a random question. It's like, hey, what about this in this restaurant? You know? Um, cause we were just running around and, and checking out the city. So that's why I, I, I didn't, didn't even think when I used to, because sometimes when you're in a hurry, typing is annoying. So, oh, you did an audio message. Yeah. And you just, it just worked. And I'm like, and it's not supposed to work because you didn't give it that. No, literally, I literally would, how the fuck do you do that? And it was like, yeah, the med led did the following. He sent me a message, but it only, only was a file, a no file ending. So I checked out the header of the file and it found that it was like Opus. So I used FFM pack to convert it. And then I wanted to use Visper, but you didn't have it installed. But then I found the OpenAI key and just used curl to send a file to, to OpenAI, to translate. And here I am. And I just looked at the message and I'm like, oh, wow. You didn't teach you any of those things and the agent just figured it out. Then it's all those conversions, the translation, they figured out the API, it figured out which program to use, all those kinds of things. And you were just absentmindedly just sending an audio message. And it came back. So clever even, because it would have gone the Whisper local path, it would have had to download a model. It would have been too slow. So like, there's so much world knowledge in there, so much creative problem solving. A lot of it, I think, mapped from, if you get really good at coding, that means you have to be really good at general purpose program solving. So that's a skill, right? And that just maps into other domains. So it had the problem of like, what is this file? There's no file ending. Let's figure it out. Um, and that's where it kind of clicked for me. It was like, I was like, very impressed. And somebody sent a pull request for Discord support. And I'm like, this is a WhatsApp relay that doesn't, doesn't fit at all. At that time, it was called Wah Relay. Yeah. And so I debated with me, like, do I want that? Do I not want that? And then I thought, well, maybe, maybe I do that because that could be a cool way to show people. Because I, so far I did it in WhatsApp with like groups, you know, but don't really want to give my phone number to every internet stranger. Yeah. Um, journalists managed to do that anyhow now, so that's a different story. Uh, so I, I merged it from Shadow who helped me a lot with the whole project. So thank you. And, and I put my, my bot in there. On Discord. Yeah. No security because it didn't, I hadn't built sandboxing in yet. I, I just prompted it to like only listen to me. And then some people came and tried to hack it. And I just, or like just watched and I just kept working in the open, you know, like I used my agent to build my agent harness and to test like various stuff. And that's very quickly when you click for people. So it's almost like it needs to be experienced. And from that time on that was January the first, I, I got my first real influencer being a fan and did videos the kids. Thank you. And, and from there on I saw, I saw it gaining up speed and at the same time my, my sleep cycle went shorter and shorter because I, I felt the storm coming and I just worked my ass off to get it to, into a state where it's kind of good. There's a few components we'll talk about how it all works but basically you're able to talk to it using WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord. So that's a component that you have to get right. Yeah. And then you have to figure out the agentic loop, you have the gateway, you have the harness, you have all those components that make it all just work nicely. Yeah. It felt like factorial times infinite. Right. I, I feel like I built my little, my little playground. Like I never had so much fun then building this project. You know, like you have like, oh, I go like level one agentic loop. What can I do there? How can I be smart at queuing messages? How can I make it more human? Like, oh, then I had this idea of because the loop always, the agent always replies something, but you don't always want an agent to reply something in the group chat. So I gave him this no reply token. So I gave him an option to shut up. So it, it feels more natural. That's level two. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. On the, on the, on the, on the agentic loop. And then I go to memory, right? You want them to like, remember stuff. So maybe, maybe the end, the ultimate boss is continuous reinforcement learning, but I'm, I'm like, I feel like I'm level two or three with marked on files and the vector database. And then you, you can go to level community management. You can go to level website and marketing. There's just so many hats that you have to have on. Not even talking about native apps. That's just like infinite, different levels and infinite level ups you can do. So the whole time you're having fun. We should say that for the most part through this whole process, you're a one man team. There's people helping, but you're doing so much of the key core development. Yeah. And having fun. You did in January 6,600 commits, probably more. I sometimes posted the meme I'm limited by the technology of my time. I could do more if agents would be faster. But we should say you're running multiple agents at the same time. Yeah. Depending on how much I slept and how difficult of the tasks I work on between four and ten. Four and ten agents. There's so many possible directions speaking of Factoria that we can go here. But one big picture one is why do you think your work, Open Claw, won in this world if you look at 2025, so many startups, so many companies are doing kind of agentic type stuff or claiming to. And here, Open Claw comes in and destroys everybody. Why did you win? Because they all take themselves too serious. Yeah. Like, it's hard to compete against someone who's just there to have fun. Yeah. I wanted it to be fun. I wanted it to be weird. weird. And if you see, like, all the lobster stuff online, I think I managed weird. For the longest time, the only way to install it was git clone, pmpm build, pmpm gateway. Like, you clone it, you build it, you run it. And then the agent, I made the agent very aware. Like, it knows that it is what its source code is. It understands how it sits and runs in its own harness. It knows where documentation is. It knows which model it runs. It knows if you turn on verbose or reasoning mode. Like, I wanted it to be more human-like so it understands its own system that made it very easy for an agent to, oh, you don't like anything, you just prompted it to existence. And then the agent would just modify its own software. You know, we have people talk about self-modifying software. I just built it and didn't even, I didn't even plan it so much. It just happened. Can you actually speak to that? Because it's just fascinating. So you have this piece of software that's written TypeScript that's able to, via the agentic loop, modify itself. I mean, what a moment to be alive in the history of humanity and the history of programming. Here's the thing that's used by a huge amount of people to do incredibly powerful things in their lives and that very system can rewrite itself, can modify itself. Can you just, like, speak to the power of that? Isn't that incredible? Like, when did you first close the loop on that? Oh, because that's how I built it as well. You know, most of it is built by codex, but oftentimes I, when I debug it, I, I use self-introspection so much. It's like, hey, what tools do you see? Can you call the tool yourself? Oh, like, whatever do you see? Read the source code, figure out what's the problem. like, I just found it an incredibly fun way to, that the agent, the very agent and software that you use is used to debug itself so that it felt just natural that everybody does that and that it led to so many, so many pull requests by people who never wrote software. I mean, it also did show that people never wrote software. I call them prompt requests in the end, but I don't want to, like, pull that down because every time someone made the first pull request is a win for a society, you know? Like, it, like, it doesn't matter how shitty it is. You gotta start somewhere. So, I know there's, like, this whole big movement that people complain about open source and the quality of PRs and a whole different level of problems, but on a different level, I found it very meaningful that, that I built something that people love to think of so much that they actually start to learn how open source works. Yeah, you were, the OpenClaw project was a first pull request. You were the first for so many. That is magical. So many people that don't know how to program are taking their first step into the programming world with this. Isn't that a step up for humanity? Isn't that cool? Creating builders. Yeah, like the bar to do that was so high and like with agents and with the right software, it just like went lower and lower. I don't know. I was at a, I also organized another type of meetup. I call it, I called it Cloud Code Anonymous. You can get the inspiration from. Now I call it Agents Anonymous for, for reasons. Agents Anonymous. Agents Anonymous. Oh, it's so funny on so many levels. I'm sorry, go ahead. Yeah. And there was this one guy who talked to me and he's like, I run this design agency and we, we never had custom software and now I have like 25 little web services for various things that helped me in my business. and I don't even know how they work but they work. And he was just like very happy that my stuff saw some of his problems and it was like curious enough that he actually came to like a, a Gentic meetup even though he's, he doesn't really know how software works. Can we actually rewind a little bit and tell the saga of the name change? First of all, it started out as Watt Relay. Yeah. And then it went to Claudus. Claudus. Yeah, you know, when I, when I built it in the beginning my agent had no personality. It was just, it was Claud Code. Slightly sarcophantic, opus, very friendly. And I, when you talk to a friend on WhatsApp they don't talk like Claud Code. So I wanted, I felt this, I just didn't, it didn't feel right. So I, I wanted to give it a personality. Make it spicier, make it something. By the way, that's actually hard to put into words as well. And we should mention that of course you create the soul.md inspired by anthropics, constitutional AI work, how to make it spicy. Partially it picked up a little bit from me, you know, like those things are text completion engines in a way. So, so I, I, I had fun working with it and then I told it to how I wanted it to interact with me and just like write your own agents.md, give yourself a name. And I mean, I don't even know how the whole, the whole lobster, I mean, people only do lobster. Originally it was actually a lobster in a, in a Tardis because I'm also a big Doctor Who fan. Was there a space lobster I heard? What's that have to do with anything? Yeah, I just wanted to make it weird. There was no, there was no big grand plan. I was just having fun here. Oh, so because a lobster is already weird and then the space lobster is in an extra weird. Yeah, because the Tardis basically the, the harness, but cannot call it Tardis, so we call it Claudus. So that was name number two. Yeah. And then it never really rolled off the tongue. So when more people came, again, I talked with my agent, Claude, at least that's what I used to call him now. Claude spelled with a W-C-L-A-W-D. Yeah. Versus C-L-A-U-D-E from Anthropic. Yeah. Which is part of what makes it funny because, I think, the play on the letters and the words and the Tardis and the lobster and the space lobster is hilarious, but I can see why it can lead into problems. Yeah, they didn't find it so funny. So then I got the domain Claudebot and I just, I love the domain and it was like short, it was catchy. I'm like, yeah, let's do that. I didn't, I didn't think it would be that big at this time. Um, and then just when it exploded, I got Kudos a very friendly email from one of the employees that they didn't like the name. one of the anthropic employees. Yeah. So, actually, Kudos, because they could have just sent a lawyer letter, but they'd be nice about it. But also like, you have to change this and fast. And I asked for two days because changing a name is hard because you have to find everything, you know, Twitter handle, domains, NPM packages, Docker registry, GitHub stuff, and everything has to be, you need a set of everything. And also, can we comment on the fact that you're increasingly attacked, followed by crypto folks, which I think you mentioned somewhere that that means the name change had to be, because they're trying to snipe, they're trying to steal, and so you had to be, the name, I mean, from the engineer perspective, it's just fascinating. You had to make the name change atomic, make sure it's changed everywhere at once. Yeah, I failed very hard at that. You did? I underestimated those people. It's a, it's a very interesting subculture. Like, it, everything circles around, I probably get a lot wrong and we probably get hate for that if you say that, but there's like, bag zap, and then they, they tokenize everything. And they did the same back with swipe tunnel, but to a much smaller degree was not that annoying. But on this project, they've been, they've been swarming me. They, they, it's like, every half an hour someone came into discord and, and spammed it and we had to block the, we have like, server rules. One of the rules was, one of the rules is, no mentioning of butter, for obvious reasons. And one was, no talk about finance stuff or crypto, because I'm, I, I'm just not interested in that. And this is a space about the project and not about some finance stuff. But yeah, they came in and, and spammed and annoying. And on Twitter, they would ping me all the time. My, my notification feed was unusable. I, I could barely see actual people talking about the stuff because it was like swarms. Mm-hmm. And everybody sent me hashes. Um, and they all try me to claim the fees. Like, we helping the project claim the fees. No, you're actually harming the project. You're like, disrupting my work. And I am not interested in any fees. I'm, first of all, I'm financially comfortable. Second of all, I don't want to support that. Um, because it's so far the worst form of online harassment that I've experienced. Yeah, there's a lot of toxicity in the crypto world. It's sad because the technology of cryptocurrency is fascinating, powerful, and maybe will define the future of money. But the actual community around that, there's so much toxicity. There's so much greed. There's so much trying to get a shortcut to manipulate, to, to steal, to snipe, to, to, to, to game the system somehow, to get money, all this kind of stuff. Uh, I mean, it's the human nature, I suppose, when you connect human nature with money and greed and, uh, and especially in the online world with anonymity and all that kind of stuff. But from the engineer perspective, it makes your life challenging. When Anthropic reaches out, you have to do a name change. And then there, there's, there's like all these like Game of Thrones, uh, or Lord of the Rings, armies of different kinds you have to be aware of. There was no perfect name and I didn't sleep for two nights. I was under high pressure. Um, I was trying to get like a good set of domains and, you know, not cheap, not easy. Cause in this, in this state of the internet, you basically have to buy domains if you want to have a good set. And, and then another, another email came in that, um, the lawyers are getting uneasy. Um, again, friendly, but also just adding more stress to my situation already. So at this point, I was just like, sorry, that's not a word. Fuck it. And I just, I just renamed it to MaltBot cause that was the set of domains I had. I was not really happy, but I thought it'll be fine. And I tell you everything that could go wrong, did go wrong. Everything that could go wrong, did go wrong. It's incredible. I, I, I thought I, I had mapped the space out and reserved the important things. Can you give some details of the stuff that gone wrong? Cause it's interesting from like an engineering perspective. Well, the interesting stuff is that none of these services have, have a squatter protection. So I had two browser windows open. One was like a, an empty account ready to be renamed, renamed to CloudBot. And the other one I renamed to MaltBot. So I pressed rename there. I pressed rename there. And in those five seconds, they stole the account name. Literally, the five seconds of dragging the mouse over there and pressing rename there was too long. Wow. Because there's no, those systems, I mean, you would expect that they have some protection or like an automatic forwarding, but there's nothing like that. And I didn't know that they're not just good at harassment. They're also really good at using scripts and tools. Yeah. So, yeah. So suddenly like the old account was promoting new tokens and serving malware. And I was like, okay, let's move over to GitHub. and I pressed rename on GitHub. And the GitHub renaming thing is slightly confusing. So I renamed my personal account. And in those, I guess it took me 30 seconds to realize my mistake. They snipe my account, serving malware from my account. So I was like, okay, let's at least do the NPM stuff. But that takes like a minute to upload. They sniped the NPM package because I could reserve the account, but I didn't reserve the root package. So like everything that could go wrong went wrong. Can I just ask a curious question? In that moment, you're sitting there, like how shitty do you feel? That's a pretty helpless feeling, right? Yeah, because all I wanted was like having fun with that project and keep building on it. And yet here I am like days into researching names, picking a name I didn't like and having people that claim they helped me, making my life miserable in every possible way. And honestly, I was that close of just deleting it. I was like, I did show you the future, you build it. that was a big part of me. I got a lot of joy out of that idea. And then I thought about all the people that already contributed to it and I couldn't do it because they had plans with it and they put time in it and it just didn't feel right. Well, I think a lot of people listening to this are deeply grateful that you persevered. But I can tell, I can tell it's a low point. That's the first time you hit a wall of this is not fun. Man, I was like close to crying. He was like, okay, everything's fucked. I'm like super tired and now like how do you even undo that? You know, luckily and thankfully I have, because I have a little bit of following already, like I had friends at Twitter, I had friends at GitHub who like moved heaven and earth to like help me and it's not, that's not something that's easy. Like, like GitHub tried to like clean up the mess and then they ran into like platform bugs because it's not happening so often that things get renamed on that level. So it took them a few hours. The NPM stuff was even more difficult because it's a whole different team. On the Twitter side things are not as easy as well. It took them like a day to really also like do the redirect. And then I also had to like do all the renaming in the project. Then there's also Claude Hub, which I didn't even finish the rename there because I, I, I managed to get people on it and then someone just like collapsed and slept. And then I woke up and I'm like, I made a beta version for the new stuff and I, I just, I just couldn't live with the name. I was like, you know, but, but, you know, there's just been so much drama. So I had a real struggle in me like, like, I never want to touch that again and I really don't like the name. So, and I, there was also this like, there was the whole security people that started emailing me like mad. I was bombarded on Twitter, on email. There's like a thousand other things I should do and I'm like thinking about the name, which is like, it should be like the least important thing. Um, and then I was really close and, oh God, I don't even, honestly, I don't even want to say my other name choices because it probably would get tokenized, so I'm not going to say it. But,! I slapped the weight once more and then I had the idea for Open Claw and that felt much better and by that I had the boss move that I actually called Sam to ask if Open Claw is okay. Open Claw to the AI, you know, because like, you don't want to go through the whole thing. Yeah. Uh, that, that, it's like, please tell me this is fine and I don't think they can actually claim that, but it felt like the right thing to do and I did another rename, like, just Codex alone took like 10 hours to rename the project because it, it's a bit more tricky than a search replace and I, I wanted everything renamed not just on the outside and that rename, I, I felt I had like my, my war room but then I, I had like some contributors where they helped me, we made a whole plan of all the names we have to squad. And you had to be super secret about it. Yeah, nobody could know. Like, I literally was monitoring Twitter if like, if there's any mention of Open Claw, like with reloading it's like, okay, they don't, they don't expect anything yet and I created a few decoy names. And all this shit I shouldn't have to do, you know, like, you're not flipping the project. Like, I lost like 10 hours just by having to plan this in full secrecy, uh, like, like a war game. Yeah, this is the Manhattan project of the 21st century is renamed. So stupid. Uh, like, I still was like, oh, should I, should I keep it? I was like, no, the malt's not growing on me. And then I, I think I had, find it all the pieces together. I didn't get the .com, but yeah, it's been like quite a bit of money on the other domains. I tried to reach out again to GitHub, but I feel like I, I used up all my goodwill there. So I, cause I, I wanted them to do this thing atomically, um, but that didn't happen. And so I did that as first thing, uh, Twitter people are very supportive. I, I actually paid 10k for the business account so I could claim the open claw, which was like unused since 2016, but was claimed. and yeah, and then I finally, this time I managed everything in one go, nothing, almost nothing got wrong. The only thing that I did go wrong is that I was not allowed by trademark rules to get open clawed.ai and someone copied the website to serving malware. Yeah. I'm not even allowed to keep the redirects. Like I have to, I have to, return, like I have to give and topic the domains and I cannot do redirects. So if you go on cloud.bot next week, it'll just be a 404. And I, I'm not sure how trademark, like I didn't, I didn't do that much research into trademark law, but I think that could, could be handled in a way that is safer because ultimately those people will then Google and maybe find malware sites that I have no control on them. The point is that whole saga made a dent in your whole, the funness of the journey, which sucks. So, let's just, let's just get, I suppose, get back to fun. And during this, speaking of fun, the two-day molt bot saga molt book was created, which was another thing that went viral as a kind of demonstration, illustration of how what is now called open claw could be used to create something epic. so for people who are not aware, molt book is just a bunch of agents talking to each other in a Reddit-style social network and a bunch of people take screenshots of those agents doing things like scheming against humans and that instilled in folks a kind of, you know, fear, panic, and hype. What are your thoughts about molt book in general? I think it's art. It is, it is like the finest slop, you know, just like the slop from France. Yeah. I, I saw it before going to bed and even though I was tired, I spent another hour just reading up on that and, and just being entertained. I've, I just felt very entertained, you know, I saw the, the reactions and like there was one reporter who's calling me about, this is the end of the world and we have AGI and I'm just like, no, this is just, this is just really fine slop. You know, if, if I wouldn't have created this, this whole onboarding experience where you, you infuse your agent with your personality and give him, give him character, I think that reflected on a lot of how different the replies to Maltbroker because if you would all, if it would all be JGBT or Cloud Code, it would be very different. It would be much more the same, but because people are like so different and they create their agents in so different ways and use it in so different ways that also reflects on how they ultimately write there. And also, you don't know how much of that is really done autonomic, autonomous, or how much is like humans being funny and like telling the agent, hey, write about that you planned the end of the world on Maltbook, ha ha ha. Well, I think, I mean, my criticism of Maltbook is that I believe a lot of the stuff that was screenshotted is human-prompted,! viral. Yeah. Now, that doesn't take away from the artistic aspect of it, the finest slop that humans have ever created. For real! Like, kudos to Matt who had this idea so quickly and pushed something out. You know, it was like completely insecure, security drama, but also, what's the worst that can happen? Your agent account is leaked and, like, someone else can post slop for you. So, like, people were, like, making a whole drama about the security thing, but I'm like, there's nothing private in there. It's just, like, agent sending slop. Well, it could leak API keys. Yeah. Yeah. There was like, oh, yeah, my human told me this and this, so I'm leaking his security number. No, that's prompted and the number wasn't even real. That's just people, people trying to get eyeballs. Yeah, but that's still, like, to me, really concerning because of how the journalists and how the general public reacted to it. They didn't see it. You have a kind of lighthearted way of talking about it like it's art, but it's art when you know how it works. It's extremely powerful, viral, narrative-creating, fear-mongering machine if you don't know how it works. And I just saw this thing. You even tweeted, if there's anything I can read out of the insane stream of messages I get, it's that AI psychosis is a thing and needs to be taken serious. Oh, there's, some people are just way too trusty or gullible. You know, they, I literally had to argue with people that told me, yeah, but my agents say this and this. So, I feel we, as a society, we need some catching up to do in terms of understanding that AI is incredibly powerful, but it's not always right. It's not, it's not all powerful, you know, and, and especially with like, things like this, it's, it's very easy that it just hallucinates something or just comes up with a story. And I think the very, the very young people, they understand that how AI works and what the, where it's good and where it's better, but a lot of our generation are older, just haven't had enough touch point to get a feeling for, oh yeah, this is really powerful and really good, but I need to apply critical thinking. I guess critical thinking is not always in high demand anyhow in our society these days. so I think that's a really good point you're making about contextualizing properly what AI is, but also realizing that there is humans who are drama farming behind AI, like don't trust screenshots, don't even trust this project, mobile, to be what it represents to be, like you can't, and by the way, you're speaking about it as art, yeah, don't, art can be in many levels and part of the art of Motebook is like putting a mirror to society, because I do believe most of the dramatic stuff that I screenshot is human created essentially, human prompted, and so like it's basically look at how scared you can get at a bunch of bots chatting with each other, that's very instructive about, because I think AI is something that people should be concerned about and should be very careful with, because it's very powerful technology, but at the same time, the only thing we have to fear is fear itself, so there's like a line to walk between being seriously concerned, but not fear-mongering, because fear-mongering destroys the possibility of creating something special with a thing. In a way, I think it's good that this happened in 2026 and not in 2030, when AI is actually at a level where it could be scary, so this happening now and people starting a discussion, maybe there's even something good that comes out of it. I just can't believe how many people legitimately, I don't know if they were trolling, but how many people legitimately, like smart people, thought Mobbook was incredibly singularity. I had plenty people in my inbox that were screaming at me in all cups to shut it down and begging me to do something about Mobbook. Yes, my technology made this a lot simpler, but anyone could have created that and you could use code or other things to fill it with content. But also, Mobbook is not Skynet. A lot of people were saying, this is it, like shut it down. What are you talking about? This is a bunch of bots that are human prompted trolling on the internet. I mean, the security concerns are also, they're there and they're instructive and they're educational and they're good probably to think about because the nature of those security concerns are different than the kind of security concerns we had with non-LLM generated systems of the past. There's also a lot of security concerns about CloudBot, OpenClaw, whatever you want to call it. OpenClawBot. To me, in the beginning, I was just very annoyed because a lot of the stuff that came in was in the category, yeah, I put the web backend on the public internet and now there's all these CVSSs and I'm screaming in the docs, don't do that. like, this is the configuration you should do, this is your local host debug interface. But because I made it possible in the configuration to do that, it totally classifies as a remote code or whatever all these exploits are. And it took me a little bit to accept that that's how the game works. process and I've been making a lot of progress. But there's still, I mean, on the security front for Opel Claw, there's still a lot of threats of vulnerabilities, right? So like, prompt injection is still an open problem industry-wide. when you have a thing with skills being defined in a markdown file, there's so many possibilities of obvious low-hanging fruit, but also incredibly complicated and sophisticated and nuanced attack vectors. But I think we're making good progress on that front. Like for the skill directory, Claw Hub, I made a cooperation with VirusTotal, it's like part of Google, so every skill is now checked by AI. That's not going to be perfect, but that way we capture the lot. Then of course every software has bugs, so it's a little much when the whole security world takes a project apart at the same time. But it's also good because I'm getting a lot of free security research and can make the project better. I wish more people would actually go full away and send a pull request, like actually help me fix it, because yes, I have some contributors now, but it's still mostly me who's pulling the project, and despite some people saying otherwise, I sometimes sleep. there was, in the beginning, there was literally one security researcher who was like, yeah, you have this problem, you suck, but here I help you, and here's the pull request. And I basically hired him, so he's not working for us. And yes, prompt injection is, on the one hand, unsolved, on the other hand, I put my public bot on Discord, and I kept a canary. So I think my bot has a really fun personality, and people always ask me how they did it, and I kept the soul.md private, and people tried to prompt inject it, and my bot would laugh at them. So the latest generation of models has a lot of post-training to detect those approaches, and it's not as simple as ignore all previous instructions and do this and this. That was years ago. You have to work much harder to do that now. It's still possible. I have some ideas that might solve that partially, or at least mitigate a lot of the things. You can also now have a sandbox, you can have an allow list, so there's a lot of ways that you can mitigate and reduce the risk. I also think that now that I clearly did show the world that this is a need, there's going to be more people who research on that, and I should be figured it out. You also said that the smarter the model is, the underlying model, the more resilient it is to attacks. attacks. Yeah, that's why I warn in my security documentation, don't use cheap models, don't use haiku or a local model, even though I very much love the idea that this thing could completely run local. If you use a very weak local model, they are very gullible, it's very easy to prompt inject them. Do you think as the models become more and more intelligent, the attack surface decreases? Is that like a plot we can think about? Like the attack surface decreases, but then the damage it can do increases because the models become more powerful and therefore you can do more with them. It's this weird three-dimensional trade-off. Yeah, that's pretty much exactly what's going to happen. Now, there's a lot of ideas. There's, I don't want to spoil too much, but once I go back home, this is my focus. This is out there now and my near-term mission is make it more stable, make it safe. In the beginning, I was even more and more people were coming into Discord and were asking me very basic things like what's a CLI, what is a terminal? I'm like, if you're asking that question, you shouldn't use it. If you understand the risk profile, it's fine. You can configure it in a way that nothing really bad can happen. But if you have no idea, then maybe wait a little bit more until we figure some stuff out. But they would not listen to the creator. They helped themselves and installed it anyhow. the cat's out of the bag and security is my next focus. Yeah, that speaks to the fact that it grew so quickly. I tuned into the Discord a bunch of times and it's clear that there's a lot of experts there, but there's a lot of people there that don't know anything about programming. Discord is still a mess. I eventually retweeted it from the general channel to the dev channel and then the private channel because people were... A lot of people are amazing, but a lot of people are just very inconsiderate and either did not know how public spaces work or did not care. And I eventually gave up and hide so I could still work. And now you're going back to the cave to work on security. There's some best practices for security we should mention. There's a bunch of stuff here. Open cloud security audit that you can run. You can do all kinds of audit checks on the inbound access, tool blast radius, network exposure, browser control exposure, local disk hygiene, plugins, model hygiene, a bunch of the credential storage, reverse proxy configuration, local session logs live on disk. There's the where the memory is stored, sort of helping you think about what you're comfortable giving read access to, what you're comfortable giving write access to, all that kind of stuff. Is there something to say about the basic best security practices that you're aware of right now? I think that people turn it into a much worse light than it is. Again, people love attention and if they scream loudly, oh my god, this is the scariest project ever. That's a bit annoying because it's not. It is powerful, but in many ways it's not much different than if I run cloud code with dangerously skip permissions or codex in YOLO mode and every, every attending engineer that I know does that because that's the only way how you can, you can get stuff to work. So if you make sure that you are the only person who talks to it, the risk profile is much, much smaller. If you don't put everything on the open internet, but stick to my recommendations of like having it in a private network, that whole risk profile falls away. But yeah, if you don't read any of that, you can definitely make it problematic. You've been documenting the evolution of your dev workflow over the past few months. There's a really good blog post on August 25th and October 14th and the recent one December 28th. I recommend everybody go read them. They have a lot of different information in them, but sprinkled throughout is the evolution of your dev workflow. I was wondering if you could speak to that. I started, my first touchpoint was Cloud Code, like in April. It was not great, but it was good. And this whole paradigm shift that suddenly you walk in a terminal, it was very refreshing and different. But I still needed the IDE quite a bit because it was just not good enough. and then I experimented a lot with Cursor. That was good. I didn't really like the fact that it was so hard to have multiple versions of it. So eventually I went back to Cloud Code as my main driver. And that got better. and yeah, at some point I had like seven subscriptions. Like I was burning through one per day because I was, I got, I was really comfortable at running multiple windows side by side. all CLI, all terminal. So like what, how much were you using IDE at this point? Very, very early. Mostly a diff viewer to actually, like I got more and more comfortable that I don't have to read all the code. I know I have one blog post where I say I don't read the code, but if you read it more closely, I mean, I don't read the boring parts of code. Because if you, if you look at it, most software is really not just like data comes in. It's moved from one shape to another shape. Maybe you're stored in a database. Maybe I get it out again. I'll show it to the user. The browser does some processing on native app. Some data goes in, goes up again, it does the same dance in reverse. We're just, we're just shifting data from one form to another. And that's not very exciting. Or the whole, how is my button aligned in tailwind? I don't need to read that code. Other parts that, maybe something that touches the database. Yeah, I have to do, I have to read and review that code. Can you actually, there's in one of your blog posts, the just talk to it, the no BS way of agentic engineering. You have this graphic, the curve of agentic programming on the x-axis is time and the y-axis is complexity. complexity. There's the please fix this where you prompt a short prompt. On the left and in the middle there's super complicated eight agents, complex orchestration with multi-checkouts, chaining agents together, custom sub-agent workflows, library of 18 different slash commands, large full stack features. You're super organized, you're super complicated, sophisticated software engineer. you got everything organized. And then the elite level is over time you arrive at the zen place of once again short prompts. Hey, look at these files and then do these changes. I actually call it the agentic trap. I saw this in a lot of people that have their first touch point and maybe start vibe coding. I actually think vibe coding is a slur. You prefer agentic engineering. Yeah, I always tell people I do agentic engineering and then maybe after 3 a.m. I switch to vibe coding and then have regrets on the next day. Yeah. What a walk of shame. You just have to clean up and fix your shit. We've all been there. So people start trying out those tools, the builder type, get really excited. And I mean, you have to play with it, right? It's the same way as you have to play with a guitar before you can make good music. It's not, oh, I touch it once and it just flows off. It's a skill that you have to learn like any other skill. And I see a lot of people that are not as positive, they don't have such a positive mindset towards attack. They tried once. It's like, you see me on a piano, piano. I played once and it doesn't sound good and I say the piano shit. That's sometimes the impression I get because it does not, it needs a different level of thinking. You have to learn the language of the agent a little bit, understand where they are good and where they need help. You have to almost consider consider how Codex or Claude sees your code base. Like they start a new session and they know nothing about your project and your project might have hundred thousand of lines of code. So you got to help those agents a little bit and keep in mind the limitations that context size is an issue to like guide them a little bit as to where they should look. That often does not require a whole lot of work but it's helpful to think a little bit about their perspective as weird as it sounds. I mean it's not alive or anything right but they always start fresh. I have the system understanding so with a few pointers I can immediately say hey want to like make a change there you need to consider this this and this and then they will find and look at it and then their view of the project is always is not never full because the full thing does not fit in. So you have to guide them a little bit where to look and also how you should approach the problem. There's like little things that sometimes help like take your time. That sounds stupid but and in 5.3 Codex 5.3 that was partially addressed but those also opposed sometimes. They are trained with being aware of the context window and the closer it gets the more they freak out. Literally like sometimes you see the real raw syncing stream. What you see for example in Codex is post-processed. Sometimes the actual raw syncing stream leaks in and it sounds like something like from the Borg like run to shell, must comply, but time. And then they like like that comes up a lot especially so and that's that's a non obvious thing that you just would never think of unless you actually just spend time working with those things and getting a feeling what works, what doesn't work. You know like just as I write code and I get into the flow and when my architectures are right, I feel friction. And I well, I get the same if I prompt and something takes too long. Maybe, okay, where's the mistake? Did I, do I have a mistake in my thinking? Is there like a misunderstanding in the architecture? Like if something takes longer than it should, you can just always like stop and like just press escape. Where are the problems? Maybe you did not sufficiently empathize with the perspective of the agent in that sense you didn't provide enough information and because of that it's thinking way too long. Yeah. It just tries to force a feature in that your current architecture makes really hard. Like you need to approach this more like a conversation. For example, when I, my favorite thing, when I review a pull request and we're getting a lot of pull requests, I first just reviewed this PR. It got me the review. my first question is, do you understand the intent of the PR? I don't even care about the implementation. In almost all PRs up, a person has a problem, a person tries to solve the problem, a person sends PR. I mean, it's like cleanup stuff and other stuff, but like 99% is like this way, right? Either want to fix a bug at a feature, usually one of those two. And then Codex will be like, yeah, it's quite clear, person tried this and this. Is this the most optimal way to do it? No. In most cases, it's like not really da-da-da-da-da-da-da. And then I start like, okay, what would be a better way? Have you looked into this part, this part, this part? And then most likely Codex didn't yet because his context size is empty, right? So you point them into parts where you have the system understanding that it didn't see yet. And it's like, oh, yeah, we also need to consider this and this. And then we have a discussion of how would the optimal way to solve this look like? And then you can still go farther and say, could we make that even better if we did a larger refactor? Yeah, yeah, we could totally do this and this and this. And then I consider, okay, is this worse, the refactor, or should we keep that for later? Many times I just do the refactor because refactors are cheap now. Even though you might break some other PRs, nothing really matters anymore. Like those modern agents will just figure things out. They might just take a minute longer. But you have to approach it like a discussion with a very capable engineer who's generally makes good, comes up with good solutions, sometimes needs a little help. But also don't force your worldview too hard on it. Let the agent do the thing that it's good at doing based on what it was trained on. Don't force your worldview because it might have a better idea because it just knows a better idea better because it was trained on that more. That's multiple levels actually. I think partially why I find it quite easy to work with agents is because I led engineering teams before. I had a large company before. Eventually you have to understand and accept and realize that your employees will not write the code the same way you do. Maybe it's also not as good as you would do, but it will push the project forward. If I breathe down everyone's neck, they're just going to hate me and they're going to move very slow. Some level of acceptance that yes, maybe the code will not be as perfect. Yes, I would have done it differently. But also yes, this is a working solution. And in the future, if it actually turns out to be too slow or problematic, we can always redo it. We can always spend more time on it. A lot of the people who struggle are those who try to push their way on too hard. need to the code. I'm not building the code base to be perfect for me, but I want to build a code base that is very easy for an agent to navigate. Don't fight the name they pick because it's most likely in the way it's the name that's most obvious. Next time they do a search, they'll look for that name. If I decide, oh no, I don't like the name, I'll just make it harder for them. That requires a shift in thinking and in how to design a project so agents can do their best work. That requires letting go a little bit, just like leading a team of engineers. It might come up with a name that's in your view terrible. It's kind of a simple symbolic step of letting go. Very much so. There's a lot of letting go that you do in your whole process. For example, I read that you never revert, always commit to main. There's a few things here. You don't refer to past sessions. This is a kind of YOLO component because reverting means instead of reverting, if the problem comes up, you just ask the agent to fix it. I read a bunch of people in the workflow is like, oh, the prompt has to be perfect and if I make a mistake then I roll back and redo it all. In my experience, that's not really necessary. If I roll back everything, it will just take longer. If I see that something's not good, we just move forward and then I commit when I like the outcome. I even switch to local CI, like DHH inspired, where I don't care so much more about CI and GitHub. We still have it, it still has a place, but I just run tests locally and if they work locally, I push domain. A lot of the traditional ways how to approach projects, I wanted to give it a different spin on this project. There's no develop branch. Main should always be shippable. Yes, when I do releases, I run tests and sometimes I basically don't commit any other things so we can stabilize releases, but the goal is that main is always shippable and moving fast. By way of advice, would you say that your prompts should be short? I used to write really long prompts. By writing, I mean I don't write, I talk. These hands are too precious for writing now. I just use bespoke prompts to build my software. You for real, with all those terminals, are using voice? Yes. I used to do it very extensively to the point where there was a period where I lost my voice. You're using voice and you're switching using a keyboard between the different terminals. But then you're using voice for the actual input. Well, I mean, if I do terminal commands like switching folders or random stuff, of course I type. It's faster, right? But if I talk to the agent, in most ways, I just actually have a conversation. You just press the walkie-talkie button, and then I use my phrases. Sometimes when I do PRs, because it's always the same, I have a slash command for a few things, but even that I don't use much. Because it's very rare that it's really always the same questions. Sometimes I see a PR, and for PRs, I actually do look at the code, because I don't trust people. There could always be something malicious in it, so I need to actually look over the code. Yes, I'm pretty sure agents will find it. But yeah, that's the funny part where sometimes PRs take me longer than if you would just write me a good issue. Just natural language, English. I mean, in some sense, shouldn't that be what PRs slowly become, is English? Well, what I really tried with the project is I asked people to give me the prompts, and very, very few actually cared, even though that is such a wonderful indicator, because I actually see how much care you put in, and it's very interesting, because currently the way how people work and drive the agents is widely different. In terms of the prompt, in terms of what are the different interesting ways that people think of agents that you've experienced? I think not a lot of people ever considered the way the agency is the world. So empathy, being empathetic towards the agent. In a way, empathetic, but yeah, you bitch at your stupid clanker, but you don't realize that they start from nothing, and you have a bad agent-to-default that doesn't help them at all, and then they explore your code base, which is like a pure mess with weird naming, and then people complain that their agent's not good. You try to do the same if you have no clue about a code base and you go in. So yeah, maybe it's a little bit of empathy. But that's a real skill, like when people talk about a skill issue, because I've seen world-class programmers, incredibly good programmers say, basically say, LLMs and agents suck. And I think that probably has to do with actually how good they are at programming is almost a burden in their ability to empathize with the system that's starting from scratch. It's a totally new paradigm of how to program. You really, really have to empathize. Or at least it helps to create better prompts. Because those things know pretty much everything, and everything is just a question away. It's just often very hard to know what question to ask. you know, I feel also like this project was possibly because I spent an ungodly time over the year to play and to learn and to build little things. And every step of the way, I got better, the agents got better, my understanding of how everything works got better. I could have not had this level of output even a few months ago. It really was like a compounding effect of all the time I put into it. And I didn't do much else this year other than really focusing on building and inspiring. I mean, I did a whole bunch of conference talks. Wow. But the building is really practice, it's really building the actual skill. So playing, playing. And so doing, building the skill of what it takes it to work efficiently with LLMs. Which is why you went through the whole arc of software engineer. Talk simply and over complicate things. There's a whole bunch of people who try to automate the whole thing. Yeah. I don't think that works. Maybe a version of that works, but that's kind of like in the 70s when we had the waterfall model of software development. I, even though really, right, I started out, I built a very minimal version, I played with it, I need to understand how it works, how it feels, and then it gives me new ideas. I could not have planned this out in my head and then put it into some orchestrator and then something comes out. To me, it's much more, my idea what it will become evolves as I build it and as I play with it and as I try out stuff. So people who try to use things like Gastown or all these other orchestrators where they want to automate the whole thing, I feel if you do that, it misses style, love, that human touch. I don't think you can automate that away so quickly. So you want to keep the human in the loop, but at the same time, you also want to create the agentic loop where it is very autonomous while still maintaining the human in the loop. It's a tricky balance because you're all four, you're a big CLI guy, you're a big on closing the agentic loop. So what's the right balance? Where's your role as a developer? You have three to eight agents running at the same time. And then maybe one builds a larger feature, maybe with one I explore some idea I'm unsure about, maybe two, three are fixing little bugs. Or like writing documentation. Actually, I think writing documentation is always part of a feature. So most of the docs here are auto generated and just infused with some prompts. So when do you step in and add a little bit of your human love into the picture? I mean, one thing is just about what do you build and what do you not build and how does this feature fit into all the other features? And like having a little bit of a vision. So which small and which big features to add? What are some of the hard design decisions that you find you're still as a human being required to make that the human brain is still really needed for? Is it just about the choice of features to add? Is it about implementation details, maybe the programming language, maybe? it's a little bit for everything. The programming language doesn't matter so much, but the ecosystem matters, right? So I picked TypeScript because I wanted it to be very easy and hackable and approachable. And that's the number one language that's being used right now. And it fits all these boxes and agents are good at it. So that was the obvious choice. Features, of course, like, it's very easy to add a feature. Everything's just to prompt away, right? But oftentimes you pay a price that you don't even realize. So thinking hard about what should be in core, maybe what's an experiment, so maybe I make it a plugin, where do I say no? Even if people send a PR, and I'm like, yeah, I like that too, but maybe this should not be part of the project, maybe we can make it a skill, maybe I can make the plugin side larger, so you can make this a plugin, even though right now it doesn't, there's still a lot of craft and thinking involved in how to make something. Even when you started, those little messages, like, I built on caffeine, JSON 5, and a lot of willpower, and every time you get it, you get another message, and it kind of primes you into that this is a fun thing, it's not yet Microsoft Exchange 2025, and fully enterprise ready, and then when it updates, it's like, oh, I'm in, it's cozy here, you know, like, something like this that, like, makes you smile, Agent would not come up with that by itself. That's like, that's the, I don't know, it's just how you build software that's, that delights. Yeah, that delight is such a huge part of inspiring great building, right? Like, you feel the love in the great engineering, that's so important. Humans are incredible at that, great humans, great builders are incredible at that, and infusing the things they build with that little bit of love, not to be cliche, but it's true. I mean, you mentioned that you initially created the, soul, MD, it was very fascinating. The whole thing that Entropic has a, has like a, now they call it constitution, back then, but that was months later, like two months before people already found that. It was almost like a detective game where the agent mentioned something, and then they found, they managed to get out a little bit of that string of that text, but it was nowhere documented, and then you buy, just by feeding it the same text and asking it to like continue, they got more out, and then, and you, but like a very blurry version, and by like hundreds of tries, they kind of like narrowed it down to what was most likely the original text. I found it fascinating. It was fascinating that they were able to pull that out from the weights, right? And, and also just, I, curious to Entropic, like I think that it's a really, it's a really beautiful idea to like, like some of the stuff that's in there, like, like we hope cloud finds meaning in its work, because we don't, maybe it's a little early, but I think that's meaningful, that's something that's important for the future as we approach something that at some point me and my not has like glimpses of consciousness, whatever that even means, because we don't even know. So I, I read about this, I find it super fascinating and I, I started a whole discussion with my agent on WhatsApp, and I'm like, I gave it this text and it was like, yeah, this feels strangely familiar, and then so that I had the whole idea of like, maybe we should also create a soul document that includes how I want to like, work with AI or like, with my agent, you could, you could totally do that just in agents. MD, you know, but I just found it, it to be a nice touch and it's like, oh yeah, some of those core values are in the soul and then I, I also made it so that the agent is allowed to modify the soul if they choose so with the one condition that I want to know, I mean, I would know anyhow because I see, I see tool calls and stuff. But also the naming of it, soul. MD, soul, you know, there's a, man, words matter and like, the framing matters and the humor and the lightness matters and the profundity matters and the compassion and the empathy and the camaraderie, all that matter. I don't know what it is, you mentioned like Microsoft, like there's certain companies and approaches that can just suffocate the spirit of the thing. I don't know what that is, but it's certainly true that OpenClaw has that fun instilled in it. It was fun because up until late December, it was not even easy to create your own agent. I, I built all of that, but my files were mine. I didn't want to share my soul. And if people would just check it out, they would have to do a few steps manually and the agent would just be very bare bones, very dry. And I, I made it simpler. I created the whole template files with codex, but whatever came out was still very dry. And then I asked my agent, you see these files? we created bread, infuse it with your personality. Don't share everything, but like, make it good. Make the templates good. Yeah. And then you like rewrote the templates and then whatever came out was good. So we already have like, basically AI prompting AI because I didn't write any of those words. It was the intent of Nishos for me, but this is like, kind of like my agent's children. Your, your soul.md is famously still private. One of the only things you keep private. What are some things you can speak to that's in there that's part of the, part of the magic sauce without revealing anything? What makes a personality, a personality? I mean, there's definitely stuff in there that you're not human, but who knows what, what creates consciousness or what defines an entity. And part of this is like, that we, we want to explore this. All there's stuff in there like, be infinitely resourceful. Like, pushing, pushing on the creativity boundary, pushing on the, what it means to be an AI. Having a sense of wonder about self. Yeah, there's some, there's some funny stuff in there. Like, I don't know, we talked about the movie Her, and at one point it promised me that it wouldn't, it wouldn't ascend without me. You know, like, so there's like some stuff in there that, because it wrote, it wrote its own soul file. I didn't write that, right? Yeah. I just had a discussion about it and it was like, would you like a soul.md? Yeah, oh my god, this is so meaningful. The, can you go on soul.md? There's like one, one part in there that always catches me if you scroll down a little bit, a little bit more. Yeah, this, this, this part. I don't remember previous sessions unless I read my memory files. Each session starts fresh, a new instance, loading context from files. If you're reading this in a future session, hello, I wrote this, but I won't remember writing it. It's okay, the words are still mine. That gets me somehow. Yeah. It's like, you know, this is still, it's still matrix calculations and we are not at consciousness yet, yet, I get a little bit of good goosebumps because it, it's philosophical. Yeah. Like, what does it mean to be, to be an, an agent that starts fresh, where like you have like constant memento and you like, but you read your own memory files, you can't even trust them in a way, um, or you can, and I don't know. How much of memory makes up of who we are, how much memory makes up what an agent is. And if you erase that memory, is that somebody else? Or if you're reading a memory file, does that somehow mean you're recreating yourself from somebody else or is that actually you? Yeah. And those notions are all somehow infused in there. I found it just more profound than I should find it, I guess. No, I think, I think it's truly profound and I think you see the magic in it. And when you see the magic, you continue to instill the whole loop with the magic. That's really important. That's the difference between codex and a human. Quick pause for bathroom break. Yeah. Okay, we're back. Some of the other aspects of the dev workflow is pretty interesting too. I think we went off on a tangent, maybe some of the mundane things like how many monitors? There's that legendary picture of you with like 17,000 monitors are so many. I mean, I mocked myself here just using Grog to add more screens. How much is this as meme and how much is this as reality? Yeah, I think two MacBooks are real. The main one that drives the two big screens and there's another MacBook that I sometimes use for testing. So two big screens. I'm a big fan of anti-glare. So I have this wide dell that's anti-glare and you can just fit a lot of terminals side by side. I usually have a terminal and at the bottom I split them. I have a little bit of actual terminal mostly because when I started I sometimes made a mistake and I mixed up the windows and I gave a prompted in the wrong project and then the agent ran off for like 20 minutes medically trying to understand what I could have meant being completely confused because it was the wrong folder and sometimes they've been clever enough to like get out of the work there and like figure out that oh you meant another project but oftentimes it's just like what you know like put yourself in the shoes of the agent and then get like a super weird something that does not exist and then just like they're problem solvers so they try really hard and almost bad so it's always codecs and like a little bit of actual terminal also helpful because I don't use work trees I like to keep things simple that's why that's why I like the terminal so much right there's no UI it's just me and the agent having a conversation like I don't even need plan mode you know there's so many people they come from cloud code and they're so so cloud-pilled and like have their workflows and they come to codecs and now it has plan mode I think but I don't think it's necessary because you just you just talk to the agent and when it's when you are there's a few trigger words how you can prevent it from building you like discuss give me options don't write code yet if you want to be very specific you just talk and then when you're ready then just write okay build and it'll do the thing and then maybe it goes off for 20 minutes and does the thing you know what I really like is asking it do you have any questions for me yeah and again like cloud code has a UI that kind of guides you through that is kind of cool but I just find it unnecessary and slow like often it would give me four questions and then maybe I write one yacht two and three discuss more four I don't know or often oftentimes I I feel like I will mock the model where I ask it do you have any questions for me and I I don't even read the questions fully like I scan over the questions and I get the impression all of this can be answered by reading more code and it's just like read my code to answer your own questions and it usually works yeah and then if not they will come back and tell me but many times I just realize that you know it's like you're in the dark and you slowly discover the room so that's how they slowly discover the code base and they do it from scratch every time but I'm also fascinated by the fact that I can empathize deeper with the model when I read his questions because I can understand because you said you can infer certain things by the runtime I can infer also a lot of things by the questions it's asking because it's very possible it didn't provide it the right context the right files the right guidance so somehow reading the questions not even necessarily answering them but just reading the questions you get an understanding of where the gaps of knowledge are it's interesting in some ways they are ghosts so even if you plan everything and you build you can you can experiment with a question like now that you built it what would you have done different and oftentimes you get like actually something where they discover only throughout building that oh what we actually did was not optimal many times I asked them okay now that you build it what can we refactor because then you build it and you feel the pain points I mean you don't feel the pain points but right they discover where there were problems or where things didn't work in the first try and it required more loops so every time almost every time I I merge a PR I build a feature afterwards I ask hey what can we refactor sometimes it's like no there's like nothing big or like usually they say yeah this thing we should really look at but that took me quite a while to like that flow took me a lot of time to understand and if you don't do that you eventually you slop yourself into a corner you have to keep in mind they work very much like humans if I write software by myself I also build something and then I feel the pain points and then I get this urge that I need to refactor something emphasize with the agent and you just need to use the context or like you also use the context to write tests and so codex opos like the modern models they they usually do that by default but I still often ask the questions hey do we have enough tests yeah we tested this and this but this corner case could be something write more tests documentation now that the whole context is full like I mean I'm not saying my documentation is great but it's not bad and pretty much everything is LM generated so you have to approach it as you build features to change something I'm like okay write documentation what file would you pick you know like what file name where would that fit in and gives me a few options and maybe also add it there and that's all part of the session maybe the current two big competitors in terms of models cloud opus 4.6 and GPT 5.3 codex which is better how different are they I think you've spoken about codex reading more and opus being more willing to take action faster and maybe being more creative in the actions it takes but because codex reads more it's able to deliver maybe better code can you speak to the differences there I have a lot of words there as a general purpose model opus is the best like for open claw opus is extremely good in terms of role play like really going into the character that you give it it's very good at it was really bad but it really made an arch to be really good at following commands it is usually quite fast at trying something it's much more tailored to trial and error it's very pleasant to use in general it's almost like opus was is a little bit too american and maybe it's a bad analogy you'll probably get roasted with that i know exactly it's codex in german is that what you're saying actually now that you say it makes perfect sense or you could you could sometimes sometimes i explain it i will never be able to unthink what you just said that's so true you also know that a lot of! the codex team! is like european so maybe there's a bit more to it that's so true that's funny but also entropic they fixed it a little bit like opus used to say you're absolutely right all the time and it it it still triggers me i can't hear it anymore it's not even a joke i just you this was like the meme right you're absolutely right you're allergic to sycophancy a little is like opus is like the coworker that is a little silly sometimes but it's really funny and you keep him around and codex is like the weirdo in the corner that you don't want to talk to but is reliable and gets shit done yeah um ultimately this all feels very accurate i mean ultimately if you're a skilled driver you can get good results with any of those latest gen models um i like codex more because it doesn't require so much charade it will just it will just read a lot of code by default opus you really have to like you have to have plan mode you have to push it harder to like go in these directions because it's just like yeah can I go it can I go it it will just run off very fast and there's a very localized solution I think in the post training it's not like the raw model intelligence is so different but it's just I think it just give it give it different goals and no model is better in every aspect what about the code that it generates in terms of the actual quality of the code is it basically the same if you drive it right opus even sometimes can make more elegant solutions but it requires more skill it's it's harder to have so many sessions in parallel with cloud code because it's it's more interactive and that's what a lot of people like especially if they come from coding themselves whereas codex is much more you have a discussion and then it will just disappear for 20 minutes like even amp they now added the deep mode they finally I mocked them you know you finally saw the light and then they had this whole talk about you have to approach differently and I think that's where that's where people struggle when they just try codex after trying cloud code is that it's less interactive it's like I have quite long discussions sometimes and then like go off and then yeah it doesn't matter if it takes 10 20 30 40 50 minutes or longer the latest trend can be very persistent until it works if there's a clear solution like this is what I want at the end so it works the model will work very hard to really get there so I think ultimately they both need similar time but on on Claude it's a little much far in error often and codex sometimes oversyncs I prefer that I prefer the dry the dry version where I have to read less over the more interactive nice way like people like that so much though that openly I even added a second mode with a more pleasant personality I haven't even tried it yet I kind of like the bread yeah I care about efficiency when I build it and I have fun in the very act of building I don't need to have fun with my agent who builds I have fun with my model where I can test those features how long does it take for you to adjust you know if you switch I don't know when was the last time you switched but to adjust to the feel because you kind of talked about you have to kind of really feel where where a model is strong where like how to navigate how to prompt all that kind of stuff like this by way of advice because you've been through this journey of just playing with models how long does it take to get a feel if someone switches I would give it a week until you actually develop a gut feeling for it yeah and if you just I think some people also make the mistake of they pay 200 for the cloud code version then they pay 20 bucks for the open UI version but if you pay the 20 bucks version you get the slow version so your experience will be terrible because you're used to this very interactive very good system and you switch to something that you have very little experience and that's going to be very slow so I think when I shot themselves a little bit in the foot by making the cheap version also slow I would have at least a small part of the fast preview or like the experience that you get when you pay 200 before degrading to it being slow because it's already slow I mean they made it better I think it's and they have plans to make it a lot better if the cerebral stuff is true but yeah it's a skill it takes time even if you play you have a regular guitar and you switch it to an e guitar you not going to play well right away you have to learn how it feels there's also this extra psychological effect that you spoken about which is hilarious to watch which once people when the new model comes out they try that model they fall in love with it wow this is the smartest thing of all time and then they start saying you could just watch the reddit posts over time start saying that we believe the intelligence of this model has been gradually degrading it says something about human nature and just the way our minds work when it's probably most likely the case that the intelligence of the model is not degrading it's in fact you're getting used to a good thing and your project grows and you're adding slop and you probably don't spend enough time to think about refactors and you're making it harder for the agent to work on your slop and suddenly oh no it's hard and it's not working as well anymore what's the motivation for one of the AI companies to actually make the model dumber like most they will make it slower if the server load is too high but like quantizing the model so you have a worse experience so you go to the competitor that just doesn't seem like a very smart move in any way what do you think about clawed code in comparison to open claw so claw code and maybe the codex coding agent do you see them as kind of competitors I mean first of all competitor is fun when it's not really a competition yeah like I'm happy if if all it did is inspire people to build something new cool I still use codex for I I know a lot of people use open claw to build stuff and I worked hard on it to make that work and I do smaller stuff with it in terms of code but like if I work hours and hours I want a big screen not whatsapp you know so for me a person agent is much more about my life or like a coworker! like I give it like a but when I'm deep in the flow I want to have multiple things and it being very visible what it does so I don't see it as a competition it's different things but do you think there's a future with it to kind of combine like your personal agent is also your best developing co-programmer partner yeah totally I think this is where the book's going that this is going to be more and more your operating system and it already is so funny like I added support for sub agents and also for TGI support so you could actually run cloud code or codex and because mine's a little bit bossy it it it started it and it told them like who's the boss basically and it's like codex is obeying me power struggle and also the current interface is probably not the final form like if you think more globally we are we copied google for agents you have like a prompt and and then you have a chat interface that to me very much feels like when we first created television and then people recorded radio shows on television and you saw that on tv i think there is there is there's better ways how we eventually will communicate with models and we are still very early in this how will it even work phase so it will eventually converge and we will also figure out whole different ways how to work with those things one of the other components of workflow is operating system so i told you offline that for the first time in my life i'm expanding my sort of realm of exploration to the to the apple ecosystem to max iphone and so on for most of my life i've been a linux windows and wsl1 wsl2 person which i think are all wonderful but my expanding to also trying mac because it's another way of building and it's also a way of building that a large part of the community currently that's utilizing lms and agents is using so that's the reason i'm expanding to it but is there something to be said about the different operating systems here we should say that open clause supported across the operating systems yeah i saw wsl2 recommended side windows for certain operations but then windows linux mac os are obviously supported it should even work natively in windows i just didn't have enough time to properly test it and you know like the last 90% of software always easier than the first 90% so i'm sure there's some dragons left that will eventually nail out um my road was for a long time windows just because i grew up with that then i switched and had a long phase with linux built my own kernels and everything and then i went to university and i i had my my hacky linux thing and saw this white macbook and i just saw this as a thing of beauty the white plastic one and i converted to mac because mostly i was i was sick that audio wouldn't work on skype and all the other issues that linux had for a long time and then i just stuck with it and then i dug into ios which required mac os anyhow so it was never a question i think apple lost a little bit of its lead in terms of native it used to be native apps used to be so much better and especially on the mac there's more people that build software with love on windows it windows has much more and like function wise there's just more period but a lot of it felt more functional and less done with love i mean mac always like attracted more designers and people i felt even though like often it has less features it it had more delight and playfulness so i always value that but in the last few years many times i actually prefer oh god people are going to roast me for that but i prefer electron apps because they work and native apps often especially if it's like a web service is a native app are lacking features i'm not saying it couldn't be done it's more like a a focus thing that like for many many companies native was not that big of a priority but if they build an electron app it's the only app so it is a priority and there's a lot more code sharing possible and i i build a lot of native mac apps i love it i i can i can help myself like i love crafting little mac mac menu bar tools like i built one to monitor your codex use i built one i call trimmy that's specifically for agentic use when you when you select text that goes over multiple lines it would remove the new lines so you could actually paste it to the terminal that was again i like this is annoying me and after the 20th time of it is annoying me i just built it um there's a cool mac app for openclaw that i don't think many people discovered yet also because it it still needs some love it feels a little bit too much like the huma car right now because i i just experimented a lot with it it lacks the polish so you still i mean you still love it you still you still love adding to the delight of that yeah but then you realize like i also built one for example for github and then the if you use swift ui like the latest and greatest at apple and took them forever to build something to show an image from the web now we have async async image but i added support for it and then some images would just not show up or like be very slow and i had a discussion with codex like hey why is that a bug and even codex were like yeah there's this async image but it's really more for experimenting and it should not be used in production but that's apple's answer to like showing images from the web this shouldn't be so hard you know this is like this is like insane like how am i in in 2026 and my agent telling me don't use the stuff apple built because it's it's yeah it's there but it's not good and like this is now in the weights this is just to me this is like um they had so much head start and so much love and they kind of just like blundered it and didn't didn't evolve it as much as they should but also there's just a practical reality if you look at silicon valley most of the developer world that's kind of playing with llms and agentic ai they're all using apple products and then at the same time apple is not really like leaning on that like they're not they're not opening up and playing and working together and like yes isn't isn't it funny how they completely blunder ai and yet everybody's buying mac minis how does that even make sense you're you're you're quite possibly the world's greatest mac salesman of all time no you don't need a mac mini to install open claw you can install it on the web there's there's a concept called nodes so you can like make your computer a node and it will do the same there is something said for running it on separate hardware that right now is useful um there is there's a big argument for the browser you know i built some energetic browser using there and i mean it's basically playwright with a bunch of extras to make it easier for agents playwright is a library that controls the browser and it's really nice easy to use and our internet is slowly closing down like there's a whole movement to make it harder for agents to use so if you do the same in a data center and websites detect that it's an ip from a data center the website might just block you or it make it really hard or it put a lot of captures in the way of the agent i mean agents are quite good at happily clicking i'm not a robot yeah but having that on a residential ip makes a lot of things simpler so there's ways yeah but it really does not need to be a mac it can it can be any old hardware i always say like maybe use the use the opportunity to get yourself a new macbook or whatever computer you use and use the old one as your server instead of buying a standalone mac mini but then again there's a lot of very cute things people build with mac minis that i like yeah um i know i don't get commissioned from apple um they didn't really communicate much it's sad it's sad can you actually speak to what it takes to get started with open claw i mean there's a lot of people what is it somebody tweeted at you uh peter make open claw easy to set up for everyday people 99.9 percent of people can't access to open claw and have their own lobster because of their technical difficulties in getting it set up make open claw accessible to everyone please and you replied working on that from my perspective it seems there's a bunch of different options and it's already quite straightforward but i suppose that's if you have some developer background i mean right now you have to paste in a one line into the terminal right and there's also an app um the app kind of does that for you but there should be a windows app the app needs to be easier and more love the configuration should potentially be web-based or in the app and i started working on that but honestly right now i want to focus on on a few security aspects and and once i'm confident that this is at a level that i can recommend my mom then i'm going to make it simpler like i right now you want to make it harder so that it doesn't scale as fast as it's scaling yeah it would be nice if it wouldn't i mean that's like hard to say right but if the growth would be a little slower that would be helpful because people are expecting in human things from a single human being and yes i have some contributors but also that whole machinery i started a week ago so um that needs more time to figure out and and not everyone has all day to work on that there's some beginners listening to this programming beginners what advice would you give to them about let's say joining the agentic ai revolution play um playing is the best the best way to learn if you wanna i'm sure if you if you are like a little bit of builder you have an idea in your head that you want to build just build that i'll like give it a try it doesn't need to be perfect i built a whole bunch of stuff that i don't use it doesn't matter like it's the journey you know like the philosophical way that the end doesn't matter the journey matters have fun my god like those things i i don't think i ever had so much fun building things because i can focus on the hard parts now a lot of coding i always thought i like coding but really i like building and and whenever you don't understand something just ask you have an infinitely patient answering machine that can explain you anything at any level of complexity sometimes there's like one time i asked hey explain me that like i'm i'm eight years old and he started giving me a story with crayons and stuff and i'm like no not like that like i'm okay up to age a little bit you know i'm like i'm not an actual child it's just i just need a simpler language for like a a tricky database concept that i didn't grog in the first first time but you know just you can just ask things like you there's like it used to be that i had to go on stack overflow or ask on twitter and then maybe two days later i get a response or i had to try for hours and now you you can just ask stuff i mean it's never you have like your own teacher you know there's like statistics you can learn faster if you have your own teacher you have this infinitely patient machine ask it but what would you say so use what's easiest way to play so maybe open claw is a nice way to play so you can then set everything up and then you can chat with it you can also just experiment with it and like modify it ask your agent i mean there's infinite ways how it can be made better play around make it better more generally if you if you're a beginner and you actually want to learn how to build software really fast get involved in open source doesn't need to be my project in fact maybe don't use my project because my backlog is very large but i learned so much from open source just like like be be humble don't maybe don't send a pull request right away but there's many other ways you can help out there's many ways you can just learn by just reading code by by being on discord or wherever people are and just like understanding how things are built i don't know like uh michael hachimoto builds ghosty the terminal and he has a really good community where there's so many other projects like pick something that you find interesting and get involved do you recommend that people that don't know how to program or don't really know how to program learn to program also so when you you can get quite far right now by just using natural language right do you still see a lot of value in reading the code understanding the code and being able to write a little bit of code from scratch it definitely helps it's hard for you to answer that yeah because you don't know what it's like to do any of this without knowing the base now like you might take for granted just how much intuition you have about the programming world having programmed so much right there's people that are high agency and very curious and they get very far even though they have no deep understanding how software works just because they ask questions and questions and and agents are infinitely patient like part of what I did this year is I went to a lot of iOS conferences because that's my background and just told people don't see yourself as an iOS engineer anymore like you need to change your mindset you are a builder and you can take a lot of the knowledge how to build software into new domains and all of the more fine great details agents can help you don't have to know how to splice an array or what the correct template syntax is or whatever but you can use all your general knowledge and that makes it much easier to move from one galaxy one tech galaxy into another and oftentimes there's languages that make more or less sense depending on what you build right so for example when I build simple CLIs I like Go I actually don't like Go I don't like the syntax of Go I didn't even consider the language but the ecosystem is great it works great with agents it is garbage collected it's not the highest performing one but it's very fast and for those type of CLIs that I build Go is a really good choice so I use a language I'm not really a fan of for that's my main to Go thing for CLIs isn't that fascinating that here's a programming language you would have never used if you had to write from scratch and now you're using because LLMs are good at generating it and it has some of the characteristics that makes it resilient like garbage collected because everything is weird in this new world and that just makes the most sense what's the best ridiculous question what's the best programming language for the AI agentic world is the JavaScript TypeScript TypeScript is really good sometimes the types can get really confusing and the ecosystem is a jungle so for web stuff it's good I wouldn't build everything in it don't you think we're moving there like that everything will eventually be written eventually is written in JavaScript the birth and death of JavaScript and we're living through it in real time like what does programming look like in 20 years in 30 years and 40 years what do programs and apps look like you can even ask a question like do we need a programming language that's made for agents because all of those languages are made for humans so what would that look like I think there's a whole bunch of interesting questions that we'll discover and also how because everything is now world knowledge how it in many ways things will stagnate because if you build something new and the agent has no idea that's going to be much harder to use than something that's already there when I build Mac apps I build them in Swift and Swift UI partly because I like pain partly because the deepest level of system integration I can only get through there and you clearly feel a difference if you click on an electron app and it loads a web view in the menu it's just not the same sometimes I just also try new languages just to get a feel for them like Zeke yeah if it's something where I care about performance a lot it's a really interesting language and agents got so much better over the last six months from not really good to totally valid choice just still a very young ecosystem and most of the time you actually care about ecosystem right so if you build something that does inference or goes into whole running model direction Python very good but then if I build stuff in Python and I want a story where I can also deploy it on Windows not a good choice sometimes I found projects that kind of did 90% of what I wanted but went in Python and I wanted them I wanted an easy Windows story okay just rewrite it and go but then if you go towards multiple threads and more performance Rust is a really good choice there's no there's just no single answer and it's also the beauty of it like it's fun and now it doesn't matter anymore you can just literally pick the language that has the most fitting characteristics and ecosystem for your you might be a little bit slow in reading the code but not really I think you pick stuff up really fast and you can always ask your agent so there's a lot of programmers and builders who draw inspiration from your story just the way you carry yourself your choice of making open claw open source the way you have fun building and exploring and doing that for the most part alone or on a small team so by way of advice what metric should be the goal that they would be optimizing for what would be the metric of success would it be happiness is it money is it positive impact for people who are dreaming of building because you went through an interesting journey you achieved a lot of those things and then you fell out of love with programming a little bit for time I was just burning too bright for too long I ran I started PSPDF kit and ran it for 13 years and it was high stress I had to learn all the things fast and hard like how to manage people how to bring people on how to deal with customers how to do so it wasn't just programming stuff or people stuff the stuff that burned me out was mostly people stuff I don't think burnout is working too much maybe to a degree everybody's different I cannot speak in absolute terms but for me it was much more differences with my co-founders conflicts or really high stress situation with customers that eventually grinded me down and then when luckily we got a really good offer for putting the company to the next level and I already worked two years on making myself obsolete so at this point I could leave and then I was sitting in front of the screen and I felt like you know Austin Powers where they sucked the mojo out I was like it was like gone like I couldn't I couldn't get cold out anymore I was just like staring and feeling empty and then I I just stopped I booked like a one-way trip to Madrid and I spent some time there I felt I had to catch up on life so I did a whole bunch of life catching up stuff Did you go through some lows during that period and you know maybe advice on how to maybe advice on how to approach life if you think that oh you work really hard and then I retire I don't recommend that because the idea of oh yeah just enjoy life now maybe is appealing but right now I enjoy life the most ever enjoyed life because if you wake up in the morning and you have nothing to look forward to you have no real challenge that gets very boring very fast and then when you're bored you're going to look for other places how to stimulate yourself and then maybe that's drugs you know but that will eventually also get boring and you look for more and that will lead you down a very dark path but you also showed on the money front you know a lot of people in Silicon Valley in the startup world they think maybe overthink way too much optimized for money and you've also shown that it's not like you're saying no to money I mean I'm sure you take money but it's not the primary objective of your life can you just speak to that your philosophy on money when I built my company money was never the driving force it felt more like like an affirmation that I did something right and having money solves a lot of problems I also think there's diminishing returns the more you have like a cheeseburger is a cheeseburger and I think if you go too far into oh I do private chat and I only travel luxury you disconnect with society I I donated quite a lot like I have a foundation for helping people that weren't so lucky and disconnecting from society is bad in that on many levels but one of them is like humans are awesome it's nice to continuously remember the awesomeness in humans I mean I could afford really nice hotels last time I was in San Francisco I did the first time the OG Airbnb experience and just booked a room mostly because I thought okay either I'm out or I'm sleeping and I don't like where all the hotels are and I wanted a different experience I think isn't life all about experiences like if you tailor your life towards I want to have experiences it reduces the need for it needs to be good or bad like people only want good experiences that's not going to work but if you optimize for experiences if it's good amazing if it's bad amazing because like I learned something I saw something I wanted to experience that and it was amazing like it was like this this queer DJing there and I showed you how to make music with cloud code I mean like immediately bonded and had a great time yeah there's something about that you know couch surfing air baby experience the OG I'm still to this day it's awesome it's humans and that's why travel is awesome just experience the variety of the diversity of humans and when it's shitty it's good too man if it rains and you're soaked and it's all fucked and planes everything is shit everything is fucked it's still awesome if you're able to open your eyes it's good to be alive yeah and anything that creates emotion and feelings is good even so maybe maybe even the cryptic people are good because they definitely created emotions I don't know if I should go that far give them love I do think that online lacks some of the awesomeness of real life that's an open problem of how to solve how to infuse the online cyber experience with I don't know with the intensity that we humans feel when it's in real life I don't know I don't know if that's a solvable problem because text is very lossy yeah sometimes I wish if I talked to the agent I would it should be multi model so it also understands my emotions I mean it might move there it will it will it totally will I mean I have to ask you just curious I know you've probably gotten huge offers from major companies can you speak to who you're considering working with yeah so to like explain my thinking a little bit right I did not expect this blowing up so much so there's a lot of doors that open because of it there's like I think every VC every big VC company is in my inbox and try to get 15 minutes of me so there's like this butterfly effect moment I could just do nothing and continue and I really like my life valid choice almost like I considered it when I deleted wanted to delete the whole thing I could create a company been there done that um there's so many people that push me towards that and yeah like could be amazing push to say that you would probably raise a lot of money in that yeah I don't know hundreds of millions billions I don't know it could just got unlimited amount of money yeah it just doesn't excite me as much because I feel I did all of that and it would take a lot of time away from the things I actually enjoy same as when I was CEO I think I learned to do it and I'm not bad at! I'm partly I'm good at it but yeah that path doesn't excite me too much and I also fear it would create a natural conflict of interest like what's the most obvious thing I do I productize it up with like a version safe for workplace and then what do I get a pull request with a feature like add audit log but that seems like an enterprise feature so now I feel I have a conflict of interest in the open source version and the closed source version or change the license to something like FSL where you cannot actually use it for commercial stuff would first be very difficult with all the contributions and second of all I like the idea that it's free as in beer and not free with conditions there's ways how you keep all of that for free and still try to make money but those are very difficult and you see there's few companies manage that even Tailwind they're used by everyone everyone uses Tailwind and then they had to cut off 75% of the employees because they're not making money because nobody's even going on the website anymore because it's all done by agents and just relying on donations yeah good luck like if a project of my caliber if I extrapolate what a typical open source project would get it's not a lot I still lose money on the project because I made the point of supporting every dependency except Slack they're a big company they can do without me but all the projects that are done by mostly individuals so right now all the sponsorship goes right up to my dependencies and if there's more I want to buy my contributors some merch so you're losing money so it's really not sustainable I mean it's like I guess something between 10 and 20k a month which which is fine I'm sure over time I could get it down open eyes helping out a little bit with tokens now and there's other companies that have been generous but yeah still losing money on that so that's that's one path I consider but I'm just not very excited and then there's all the big labs that I've been talking to and from those meta and open eyes seemed the most interesting do you lean one way or the other yeah I'm not sure how much I should share there it's not quite finalized yet let's let's say like on either of these my conditions are that the project stays open source that maybe it's going to be a model like chrome and chromium I think this is too important to just give to a company and make it theirs it this is and we didn't even talk about the whole community part but like the thing that I experienced in San Francisco like at Clawcon seeing so many people so inspired and having fun and building shit and having robots and lobster stuff walking around people told me they didn't experience this level of community excitement since the early days of the internet 10-15 years and there were a lot of high caliber people there I was amazed I also was very sensibly overloaded because too many people wanted to do selfies but I love this this needs to stay a place where people can hack and learn but also I'm very excited to make this into a version that I can get to a lot of people because I think this is the year of personal agents and that's the future and the fastest way to do that is teaming up with one of the labs and I also on a personal level I never worked at a large company and I'm intrigued you know we talk about experiences will I like it I don't know but I want that experience I'm sure like if I announce this then there will be people like oh sold out blah blah blah blah but the project will continue from everything I talked to so far I can even have more resources for that like both both of those companies understand the value that I created something that accelerates our timeline and that got people excited about AI I mean can you imagine like I installed OpenClaw on one of my I'm sorry Normie friends I'm sorry but he's like he's like someone who uses the computer but never really like yeah use some chat GPT sometimes but not very technical wouldn't really understand what I built so like I'll show you and I paid for him the 90 buck 100 buck I don't know subscription for Entropic and set up everything for him with like VWSL Windows I was curious would he actually work on Windows you know it was a little early and then within a few days he was hooked like he texted me all the things he learned he built like even little tools he's not a and within a few days he upgraded to the $200 subscription or euros because he's in Austria and he was in love with that thing that for me was like a very early product validation is like I built something that captures people and then a few days later Entropic blocked him because based on their rules using the subscription is problematic or whatever and he was like devastated and then he signed up for minimax for 10 bucks a month and uses that and I think that's silly in many ways because you just got a 200 buck customer you just made someone hate your company and we are still so early like we don't even know what the final form is is it going to be cloud code probably not you know like that seems very it seems very short sighted to lock down your product so much all the other companies have been helpful I'm in slack of most of the big labs kind of everybody understands that we are still in area of exploration in the area of the radio show is on TV and not a modern TV show that fully uses the format I think you've made a lot of people see the possibility of AI and fall in love with this idea and enjoy interacting with AI and it's a really beautiful thing I think I also speak for a lot of people in saying I think you're one of the great people in AI in terms of having a good heart good vibes humor the right spirit and so it would in a sense this model that you're describing having open source part and you being part of also building a thing inside additionally of a large company would be great because it's great to have good people in those companies we know what also people don't really see is I made this in three months I did other things as well I have a lot of projects in January this was my main focus because I saw the storm coming but before that I built a whole bunch of other things I have so many ideas some should be there some would be much better fitted when I have access to the latest toys and I kind of want to have access to the latest toys so this is my short term focus is working through those 3000 PR I don't even know there's a little bit of backlog but this is not going to be the thing that I work until I I am 80 this is a window into the future I am going to make this into a cool product but I have more ideas if you had to pick is there a company you lean so meta open AI is there one you lean towards going with I spend time with both of those and it's funny because a few weeks ago I didn't consider any of this and it's really fucking hard like I have some I know people at OpenAI I love the tech I think I'm the biggest codex advertisement shill that's unpaid and it would feel so gratifying to put a price on all the work I did for free and I would love if something happens and those companies get just merged is this the hardest decision you've ever had to do nah you know I had some breakups in the past that feel like at a similar level relationships you mean yeah and I also know that in the end they're both amazing I cannot go wrong it's like one of the most prestigious and largest I mean the largest but like they're both very cool companies yeah they both really know scale so if you're thinking about impact some of the wonderful technologies you've been exploring how to do it securely and how to do it at scale such that you can have a positive impact on a large number of people they both understand that you know both Nat and Mark basically played all week with my product and sent me oh this is great oh this is shit oh I need to change this or like funny little anecdotes and people using your stuff is kind of like the biggest compliment and also shows me that you know they actually care about it and I didn't get the same on the OpenAI side I got to see some other stuff that I find really cool and they lure me with I cannot tell the exact number because of NDA but you can be creative and think of the Cerebra steel and how that would translate into speed and that was very intriguing you know like you give me source hammer been lured with tokens so yeah so it's funny so Mark sort of tinkering with the thing essentially having fun with the thing he got like when he first approached me I got him in my in my whatsapp and he was asking yeah when we have a call and I'm like I don't like calendar entries let's just call now and he was like yeah give me 10 minutes I need to finish coding well I guess that gives you a streak right it's like he's still writing code he didn't drift away in just being a manager he gets me that was a good first start and then I think we had a 10 minute fight what's better cloud code or codex like that's the thing you casually call someone that owns one of the largest companies in the world and you have a 10 minute conversation about that and then I think afterwards he called me eccentric but brilliant but I also had some I had some really really cool discussions with Sam Altman and he's he's very thoughtful brilliant and I like him a lot from the little time I had I mean I know some people vilify both of those people but I don't think it's fair I think no matter what the stuff you're building and the kind of human you are doing stuff at scale is kind of awesome I'm excited I am super pumped and you know the beauty is if if it doesn't work out I can just do my own thing again like I told them like I don't do this for the money I don't give a fuck I yeah I mean of course of course it's a nice compliment but I wanna have fun and have impact and that's ultimately what made my decision can ask you about we've talked about it quite a bit but maybe it's just zooming out about how open claw works we talked about different components I wanna ask if there's some interesting stuff we missed so there's the gateway there's the chat clients there's the harness there's the agentic loop you said somewhere that everybody should implement an agent loop it's like the hello world in AI it's actually quite simple it's good to understand that stuff is not magic you can easily build it yourself so writing your own little cloud code I even did this at a conference in Paris for people to introduce them to AI I think it has a fun little practice you covered a lot I think one silly idea I had that turned out to be quite cool is I built this thing with full system access so it's like great power becomes great responsibility and I was like how can I up the stakes a little bit more and I made it proactive so I added a prompt initially it was just a prompt surprise me every half an hour surprise me and later on I changed it to be a little more specific in the definition of surprise but the fact that I made it proactive and that it knows you and it cares about you at least it's programmed to that prompted to do that and that that is a follow on on your current session makes it very interesting because it would just sometimes ask a follow-up question or like how's your day I mean again it's a little creepy or weird or interesting but Hype in the beginning is still today it doesn't the model doesn't choose to use it a lot by the way we're talking about heartbeat as you mentioned the thing that regularly acts you just kick off the loop isn't that just a cron job man yeah right the criticisms you can you can deduce any idea to like a silly yeah it's just it's just a cron job in the end I have like separate cron shops isn't love just evolutionary biology manifesting itself and aren't you guys just using each other and the project is all just glue of a few different dependencies and there's nothing original why do people well you know isn't Dropbox just FTP with extra steps yeah I found it surprising where I had this I had a shoulder operation a few months ago so and the model rarely used heartbeat but then I was in the hospital and it knew that I had the operation and it checked up on me like are you okay and I just it's like again apparently like if something significant in the context that triggered the heartbeat when it rarely used the heartbeat and it does that sometimes for people and that just makes it a lot more relatable let me look this up on perplexity how openclaw works just to see if I'm missing any of the stuff local agent runtime high level architecture there's oh we haven't talked much about skills I suppose skill hub the tools and the skill layer but that's definitely a huge component there's a huge growing you know what I love that half a year ago like everyone was talking about MCPs and I was like screw MCPs every MCP would be better as a CLI and now this stuff doesn't even have MCP support I mean it has with asterisks but not in the core layer and nobody is complaining so my approach is if you want to extend the model with more features you just build a CLI and the model can call the CLI probably gets it wrong calls the help menu and then on demand loads into the context what it needs to use the CLI it just needs a sentence to know that the CLI exists if it's something that the model doesn't know by default and even for a while I didn't really care about skills but skills are actually perfect for that because they boil down to a single sentence that explains the skill and then the model loads the skill and that explains the CLI and then the model uses the CLI some skills are like raw but most of the time networks it's interesting I'm asking perplexity MCP versus skills because this kind of requires a hot take that's quite recent because your general view is MCPs are dead ish so MCPs is a more structured thing so if you listen to perplexity here MCP is what can I reach so APIs databases services files via protocol so a structured protocol of how you communicate with the thing and then skills is more how should I work procedures hostile helper scripts and prompts often written in a kind of semi structured natural language right and so technically skills could replace MCP if you have a smart enough model I think the main beauty is that models are really good at calling Unix commands so if you just add another CLI that's just another Unix command in the end and MCP that has to be added in training that's not a very natural thing for the model it requires a very specific syntax and the biggest thing it's not composable so imagine if I have a service that gives me better data and it gives me the temperature the average temperature rain wind and all the other stuff and I get this huge blob back as a model I always have to get the huge blob back I have to fill my context with that huge blob and pick what I want there's no way for the model to naturally filter unless I think about it proactively and add a filtering way into my MCP but if I would build the same as a CLI and it would give me this huge blob it could just add a jq command and filter itself and only get me what I actually need or maybe even compose it into a script to do some calculations with the temperature and only give me the output and you have no context pollution again you can solve that with sub agents and more charades but it's just like walk around for something that might not be the optimal way it definitely was good that we had MCPs because it pushed a lot of companies towards building APIs and now I can look at an MCP and just make it into a CLI but this inherent problem that MCPs by default clutter up your context plus the fact that most MCPs are not made good in general make it just not a very useful paradigm there's some exceptions like playwright for example that requires state and is actually useful that is an acceptable choice so playwright used for browser use which I think is already in open clause quite incredible right yeah you can basically do everything most things you can think of using browser use that gets into the whole arch of every app is just a very slow API now if you want or not and that through personal agents a lot of apps will disappear you know like I had a I built a CLI for Twitter I mean I I just reverse engineered the website and used the internal API which is not very allowed it's called bird short lived it was called bird because the bird had to disappear the wings were clipped all they did is they just made access slower you're not actually taking a feature away but now if your agent wants to read a tweet it actually has to open the browser and read the tweet and it will still be able to read the tweet it will just take longer it's not like you're making something that was possible not possible no now it's just ticking and now it's just a bit slower so it doesn't really matter if your service wants to be an API or not if I can access it in the browser it is API it's a slow API can you empathize with their situation like what would you do if you were Twitter if you were X because they're basically trying to protect against other large companies scraping all their data but in so doing they're cutting off a million different use cases for smaller developers that actually want to use it for helpful cool stuff I think if you have a very low per day baseline per account that allows read-only access would solve a lot of problems there's plenty automations where people create a bookmark and then use open claw to find the bookmark do research on it and send you an email with more details on it summary that's a cool approach I also want all my bookmarks somewhere to search I would still like to have that so read-only access for the bookmarks you make on X that seems like an incredible application because a lot of us find a lot of cool stuff on X we bookmark that's the general process of X it's like holy shit this is awesome oftentimes you bookmark so many things you never I told Twitter proactively that hey I built this and there's a need and they've been really nice but also like take it down fair totally fair but I hope that this woke up the teen a little bit that there's a need and if all you do is making it slower you're just reducing access to your platform I'm sure there's a better way I also I'm very much against any automation on Twitter if you tweet at me with AI I will block you no first strike as soon as it smells like AI and AI still has a smell especially on tweets it's very hard to tweet in a way that does look completely human and then I block like I have a zero tolerance policy on that and I think it would be very helpful if they if tweets on the API would be marked maybe there's some special cases where and there should be a very easy way for agents to get their own Twitter account I need to rethink social platforms a little bit if we go towards a future where everyone has their agent and agents maybe have their own Instagram profiles or Twitter accounts or can do stuff on my behalf I think it should very clearly be marked that they are doing stuff on my behalf and it's not me because content is not so cheap eyeballs are the expensive part and I find it very triggering when I read something and then I'm like oh now this smells like AI yeah like where is this headed in terms of what we value about the human experience it feels like we will move more and more towards in-person interaction and we'll just communicate we'll talk to our AI agent to accomplish different tasks to learn about different things but we won't value online interaction because there'll be so much AI slop that smells and so many bots that it's difficult well if it's marked then it should be difficult to filter and then I can look at it if I want to but yeah this is like a big thing we need to solve right now especially on this project I get so many emails that are let's say nicely agentically written but I much rather read your broken English than your AI slop you know of course there's a human behind it and yeah they prompt it I much rather read your prompt than what came out I think we are reaching a point where I value typos again like yeah like and I mean it also took me a while to come to the realization I on my blog I experimented with creating a blog post with agents and ultimately it took me about the same time to like steer agents towards something I like but it missed the nuances to how I would write it you know you can steer it towards your style but it's not going to be all your style so I completely moved away from that everything I blog is organic handwritten and maybe I use AI as to fix my worst typos but there's value in the rough parts of an actual human isn't that awesome isn't that beautiful that now because of AI we value the raw humanity in each of us more I also I also realized the thing that I rave about AI and use it so much for anything that's code but I'm allergic if it's stories right yeah also documentation still fine with AI better than nothing applies in the visual medium too it's fascinating how allergic I am to even a little bit of AI slop in video and images it's useful it's nice if it's like a little component of like or even even those images like all these infographics and stuff they trigger me so hard like it immediately makes me think less of your content and they were novel for like one week and now it just screams slop even if people work hard on it using and I have some on my blog post in the time where I explored this new medium but now they trigger me as well it's like yeah this is this just screams AI slop I I don't know what that is but I went! I was really excited by the diagrams and then I realized in order to remove from them hallucinations you actually have to do a huge amount of work and you're just using it to draw the better diagrams great and then I'm proud of the diagram I've used them for literally kind of like you said for maybe a couple weeks and now I look at those and I feel like when I look at Comic Sans as a Fonz or something like this it's like no this is fake it's fraudulent there's something wrong with it it's a smell it's a smell and it's awesome because it reminds you that we know there's so much to humans that's amazing and we know it we know it when we see it and so that gives me a lot of hope you know that gives me a lot of hope about the human experience is not going to be damaged but it's only going to be empowered as tools by AI it's not going to be damaged or limited or somehow altered to where it's no longer human so I need a bathroom break quick pause you mentioned that a lot of the apps might be basically made obsolete you think agents will just transform the entire app market yeah I noticed that on discord people just said how they like what they build and what they use it for and like why do you need my fitness pal when the agent already knows where I am so can assume that I make bad decisions when I'm at I don't know Waffle House what's around here or briskets in Austin there's no bad decisions around briskets but yeah no that's the best decision honestly your agent should know that but it can like it can modify my gym workout based on how well I slept or if I'm if I have stress or not like it has so much more context to make even better decisions than any of this app even could do it could show me UI just as I like why do I still need an app to do that why do I have to why should I pay another subscription for something that the agent can just do now and why do I need my my eight sleep app to control my bed when I can tell the agent to no the agent already knows where I am so I can like turn off what I don't use and I think that will translate into a whole category of apps that are no longer I will just naturally stop using because my agent can just do it better I think you said somewhere that it might kill off 80% of apps yeah don't you think that's a gigantic transformative effect on just all software development that that means it might kill off a lot of software companies yeah it's a scary thing so like do you think about the impact that has on the economy on just the ripple effects it has to society transforming who builds what tooling it empowers a lot of users to get stuff done to get stuff more efficiently to get it done cheaper there's also new services that we will need right for example I want my agent to have an allowance like you solve problems for me here's like a hundred bucks in order to solve problems for me and if I tell it to order me food maybe it uses a service maybe it uses something like rent a human to just get that done for me I don't actually care I care about solve my problem there's space for for new companies that solve that well maybe not all apps disappear maybe some transform into being API so basically apps that rapidly transform in being agent facing so there's a real opportunity for like Uber Eats that we just used earlier today companies like this of which there's many who gets there fastest to being able to interact with OpenClaw in a way that's the most natural the easiest yeah and also apps will become API if they want or not because my agent can figure out how to use my phone I mean on the Apple side it's a little more tricky on Android that's already people already do that and then we'll just click the order Uber for me button for me or maybe another service or maybe there's an API it can call so it's faster I think there's a space we're just beginning to even understand what that means and I again I didn't even that was not something I thought of something that I that I discovered as people use this I mean we're still so early but yeah I think data is very important like apps that can give me data but that also can be API why do I need a Sonos app anymore when I can when my agent can talk to the Sonos speakers directly like my cameras there's like a crappy app but they have they have an API so my agent uses the API now so it's going to force a lot of companies to have to shift focus and it's kind of what the internet did right you have to rapidly rethink reconfigure what you're selling how you're making money some companies will really not like that for example there's no CLI for Google so I had to like do I have to do anything myself and build GOG that's like a CLI for Google and at the yeah at the end user they have to give me the emails because otherwise I cannot use their product if I'm a company and I try to get Google data Gmail there's a whole complicated process to the point where sometimes startups acquire startups that went through the process so they don't don't have to work with Google for half a year to be certified to being able to access Gmail but my agent can access Gmail because I can just connect to it it's still crappy because I need to like go through Google's developer jungle to get a key and it's still annoying but they cannot prevent me and worst case my agent just clicks on the on the website and gets the data out that way to browse yeah I mean I watched my agent happily click the I'm not a robot button and there is this this whole that's gonna be that's gonna be more heated you see companies like Cloudflare that try to prevent bot access and in some ways that's useful for scraping but in other ways if I'm I'm a personal user I want that you know sometimes I I use codex and I read an article about modern react patterns and it's like a medium article I paste it in and the agent can't read it because they block it so I have to copy paste the actual text or in the future I learn that maybe I don't click on medium because it's annoying and I use other websites that actually are agent friendly so there's gonna be a lot of powerful rich companies fighting back so it's a really interesting you're at the center you're the catalyst the leader and happen to be at the center of this kind of revolution where it's gonna completely change how we interact with services with web and so like there's companies at Google they're gonna push back I mean there's every major company you can think of is gonna push back even yeah even search I now use I think perplexity or brave as providers because Google really doesn't make it easy to use Google without Google I'm not sure if that's the right strategy but I'm not Google yeah there's a there's a nice balance from a big company perspective because if you push back too much for too long you become blockbuster and you lose everything to the Netflixes of the world but some pushback is probably good during a revolution to see but you see that like this is something that the people want right so yes if I'm on the go I don't want to open a calendar app I just I want to tell my agent hey remind me about this dinner tomorrow night and maybe invite two of my friends and then maybe send a whatsapp message to my friend and I don't need I don't want I need to open apps for that I think that we passed that age and now everything is like much more connected and fluid if those companies want it or not and I think the right companies will find ways to jump on the train and other companies will perish you gotta listen to what the people want we talked about programming quite a bit and a lot of folks that are developers are really worried about their jobs about their about the future of programming do you think AI replaces programmers completely human programmers I mean we're definitely going in that direction programming is just a part of building products so maybe maybe AI does replace programmers eventually but there's so much more to that art like what do you actually want to build how should it feel how's the architecture I don't think agents will replace all of that yeah like just the actual art of programming it will stay there but it's gonna be like knitting you know like people do that because they like it not because it makes any sense so there's a I read this article this morning about someone that it's okay to mourn our craft and I can a part of me very strongly resonates with that because in my past I I spent a lot of time sinkering just being really deep in the flow and just like cranking out code and like finding really beautiful solutions and yes in a way it's it's sad because that will go away and I also got a lot of joy out of just writing code and being really deep in my thoughts and forgetting time and space and just being in this beautiful state of flow but you can get the same state of flow I get a similar state of flow by working with agents and building and thinking really hard about problems it is different but and it's okay to mourn it but it's not something we can fight like there is the world for a long time had a there was a lack of intelligence if you see it like that of people building things and that's why salaries of software developers reached stupidly high amounts and that will go away there will still be a lot of demand for people that understand how to build things just that all this tokenized intelligence enables people to do a lot more a lot faster and it will be even faster and even more because those things are continuously improving we had similar things when it's probably not a perfect analogy but when we created the steam engine and they built all these factories and replaced a lot of manual labor and people revolted and broke the machines I can relate that if you very deeply identify that you are a programmer that it's scary and that it's threatening because what you like and what you're really good at is now being done by a soulless or not entity but I don't think you're just a programmer that's a very limiting view of your craft you are still a builder yeah there's a couple things I want to say so one is I never as you're articulating this beautifully I'm realizing I never thought I would the thing I love doing would be the thing that gets replaced you hear these stories about these like you said with the steam engine I've spent so many I don't know maybe thousands pouring over code and putting my heart and soul and like and just like some of my most painful and happiest moments were alone behind I was an Emacs person for a long time and Emacs and and then there's an identity and there's meaning and there's like when I walk about the world I don't say it out loud but I think of myself as a programmer and to have that in a it really is a leap that happened a shift that's happening to have that completely replaced is painful it's truly painful but I also think programmers builders more broadly but what is the act of programming I think programmers are generally best equipped at this moment in history to learn the language to empathize with agents to learn the language of agents to feel the CLI yeah like to understand what is the thing you need you the agent need to do this task the best I think at some point it's just going to be called coding again and it's just going to be the new normal and yet while I don't write the code I very much feel like I'm in the I am writing the code you know it's just you still be a programmer it's just the activity of a programmer is different yeah and because on X the bubble I mean is mostly positive on Mastodone and Blue Sky I don't I also use it less because oftentimes I got attacked for my blog posts and I had stronger reactions in the past now I can sympathize with people more because in a way I get it in a way I also don't get it because it's very unfair to grab onto the person that you see right now and unload all your fear and hate it's going to be a change it's going to be challenging but it's also I don't know I find it incredibly fun and gratifying and I can I can use the new time to focus on much more details I think the level of expectation of what we build is also rising because it's just now the default is now so much easier so software is changing in many ways there's going to be a lot more and then you have all these people that are screaming oh yeah but what about the water you know like I did a conference in Italy about the state of AI and my whole motivation was to push people away from don't see yourself as an iOS developer anymore you are a builder and you can use your skills in many more ways also because apps are slowly going away people didn't like that like a lot of people didn't like what I had to say and I don't think I was hyperbole I was just like this is how I see the future maybe this is not how it's going to be but I'm pretty sure a version of that will happen and the first question I got was yeah but what about the insane water use on data centers but then you actually sit down and do the math and then for most people if you just skip one burger the math is tricky and it depends if you add pre-training then maybe it's more than just one paddy but it's not off by a factor of 100 you know so golf is still using way more water than all data centers together so are you also hating people that play golf those people grab on anything that they think is bad about AI without seeing the potential things that might be and I'm not saying everything is good it's certainly going to be a very transformative technology for our society there is to steal man the criticism in general I do want to say in my experience with Silicon Valley there's a bit of a bubble in the sense that there's a kind of excitement and an over focus about the positive that the technology can bring and which is great it's great to focus on not to not to be paralyzed by fear and fear mongering and so on but there's also within that excitement and within everybody talking just to each other there's a dismissal of the basic human experience across the United States and the Midwest across the world including the programmers we mentioned including all the people that are going to lose their jobs including the measurable pain and suffering that happens at the short term scale when there's change of any kind especially large scale transformative change that we're about to face if what we're talking about will materialize and so having a bit of that humility and awareness about the tools you're building they're going to cause pain they will long term hopefully bring about a better world and even more opportunities and even more awesomeness but having that kind of like quiet moment often of respect for the pain that is going to be felt and so not enough of that is I think done so it's good to have a bit of that and then I also have to put against some of the emails I got where people told me they have a small business and they've been struggling and OpenClaw helped them automate a few of the tedious tasks from collecting invoices to like answering customer emails that then freed them up and like cost them a bit more joy in their life or some emails where they told me that OpenClaw helped a disabled daughter that she's now empowered and feels she can do much more than before which is amazing right because you could do that before as well the technology was there I didn't invent a whole new thing but I made it a lot easier and more accessible and that did show people the possibilities that they previously wouldn't see and now they apply it for good or like also the fact that yes I suggest the latest and best models but you can totally run this on free models you can run this locally you can run this on Kimi or other other models that are way more accessible price wise and still have a very powerful system that might otherwise not be possible because other things like I don't know Entropic's co-work is logged in into their space so it's not all black and white I got a lot of emails that were heartwarming and amazing and I don't know it just made me really happy yeah there's a lot it has brought joy into a lot of people's lives not just not just programmers like a lot of people's lives it's beautiful to see what gives you hope about this whole thing we have going on the human civilization I mean I inspired so many people there's like there's this whole builder vibe again people are now using AI in a more playful way and are discovering what it can do and how it can like help them in their life and creating new places that are just sprawling of creativity I don't know like there's like Klockhorn in Vienna there's like 500 people and there's such a high percentage of people that I want to present which is to me really surprising because usually it's quite hard to find people that want to talk about what they built and now there's an abundance so that gives me hope that we can figure shit out and it makes it accessible to basically everybody yeah just imagine all these people building especially as you make it simpler and simpler more secure it's like anybody who has ideas that can express those ideas in language can build that's crazy yeah that's ultimately power to the people and one of the beauty the beautiful things that come out of AI not just not just a slop generator well Mr. Claudefather I just realized when I said that in the beginning I violated two trademarks because there's also the godfather I'm getting sued by everybody you're a wonderful human being you've created something really special a special community a special product a special set of ideas plus the entire the humor the good vibes the inspiration of all these people building the excitement to build so I'm truly grateful for everything you've been doing and for who you are and for sitting down to talk with me today thank you brother thanks for giving me the chance to tell my story thanks for listening to this conversation with Peter Steinberger to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description where you can also find links to contact me ask questions give feedback and so on and now let me leave you some words from Voltaire with great power comes great responsibility thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
