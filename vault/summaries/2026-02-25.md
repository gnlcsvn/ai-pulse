## Top Insights

1. **AGI timeline consensus narrowing**: Shane Legg (50/50 by 2028), Elon Musk (smarter than any human by end 2026), Dario Amodei (1-2 years for country of geniuses), Demis Hassabis (50% by end of decade). The range is tightening to 2027-2030.

2. **Coding automation accelerating faster than expected**: Multiple sources (Amodei, Altman, Legg) converge on AI doing most software engineering end-to-end within 6-12 months. Legg notes teams shrinking from 100 to 20 engineers.

3. **GDP + unemployment paradox**: Amodei explicitly predicts simultaneous 5-10% GDP growth AND ~10% unemployment - a historically unprecedented combination that will force new economic policy.

4. **Physical AI is the next frontier**: Jensen Huang sees $1T+ robotics TAM, Musk predicts more robots than people, but everyone agrees the body (robotics) lags the brain (AI cognition) by years.

5. **Safety concerns from builders themselves**: Amodei says "something will go wrong with someone's AI system," Tegmark calls the control problem "most likely unsolvable," Bengio warns of mirror life bioweapons within years.
