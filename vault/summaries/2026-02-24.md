## Top Insights

1. **AI is an approaching tsunami that society isn't recognizing** — In two separate interviews, Dario Amodei uses the tsunami metaphor to describe how close AI models are to human-level intelligence, while people keep "explaining away" the signals. Jack Clark corroborates this at Anthropic, noting Claude Code is on track to write 99% of their code
2. **Job displacement timelines are crystallizing** — Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi puts intellectual job replacement at 10 years (70-80%) and physical jobs at 15-20 years. Jack Clark predicts entry-level white-collar jobs will be touched "in the next couple of years." Both emphasize new job creation alongside displacement
3. **The coding profession is being fundamentally restructured** — Khosrowshahi says Uber may stop hiring engineers in 5 years; Clark says experienced engineers who can oversee AI are more valuable while junior roles become "more dubious"; Amodei says pure coding is being automated first, broader software engineering follows
4. **Biotech renaissance is coming** — Dario Amodei is especially bullish on peptide therapies, mRNA technology, and CAR-T treatments accelerated by AI, predicting "we're about to cure a lot of diseases"
5. **AI safety and governance remain urgent** — Yoshua Bengio calls for international AI governance akin to nuclear treaties; Jack Clark is building internal monitoring for recursive self-improvement; Dario Amodei worries societal awareness has gotten worse even as technical safety has slightly improved
6. **India is emerging as a major AI opportunity** — Both Sam Altman (at IIT Delhi) and Dario Amodei (in Bangalore) highlight India's potential, with Amodei noting 2x user growth and significant revenue from the region
