## Top Insights

1. **The scaling exponential may be ending** — Dario Amodei says we're "near the end of the exponential" in AI scaling, but gives 90% confidence AGI arrives within 10 years and sees Anthropic's revenue trajectory ($0 → $100M → $1B → $10B) as evidence AI is creating massive economic value
2. **SaaS is being replaced, not augmented** — Both Sebastian Siemiatkowski (Klarna) and the No Priors hosts argue that AI doesn't enhance existing SaaS — it replaces it entirely. Klarna has already cut from 5,000 to 3,500 employees and is eliminating vendor after vendor
3. **Coding as we know it is over** — OpenAI's Codex lead (Emberikos) and Boris Cherny (Claude Code) both describe a world where engineers become "managers of AI agents" rather than writers of code. OpenAI reports 95% internal Codex adoption and 70% more PRs
4. **AI infrastructure is going to space** — Elon Musk makes the case that solar is 5x more effective in orbit, and within 36 months the cheapest place to run AI inference will be in space via Starship-launched data centers
5. **The AI market is growing faster than cloud ever did** — a16z's David George shows top AI companies growing at 693% YoY (2.5x faster than non-AI), with Goldman Sachs projecting $9T in AI revenue and $5T in cumulative hyperscaler CapEx by 2030
