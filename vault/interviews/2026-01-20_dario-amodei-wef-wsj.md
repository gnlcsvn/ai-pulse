# Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei From World Economic Forum | WSJ

## Guests
- **Dario Amodei** - CEO & Co-founder, Anthropic
- **Emma Tucker** - Editor-in-Chief, The Wall Street Journal (interviewer)

## Key Takeaways
1. Businesses, policymakers, and governments are not doing enough to prepare for AI's impact; Amodei gave a flat "No" when asked [▶ 0:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7F6ohcBJus&t=52s)
2. AI follows a "Moore's law for intelligence" with steady exponential progress, while public perception oscillates wildly between hype and skepticism [▶ 1:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7F6ohcBJus&t=109s)
3. AI's economic signature will be simultaneously very high GDP growth (5-10%) and very high unemployment (10%), a combination never seen before [▶ 4:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7F6ohcBJus&t=259s)
4. Software is going to become cheap, maybe essentially free, upending the economics of building products that must be amortized across millions of users [▶ 5:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7F6ohcBJus&t=333s)
5. Anthropic's revenue grew from ~$0 in 2023 to ~$100M, then ~$1B in 2024, then ~$10B in 2025, following a smooth exponential curve [▶ 15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7F6ohcBJus&t=945s)
6. Anthropic's enterprise-first strategy deliberately avoids the consumer engagement maximization race between Google and OpenAI [▶ 11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7F6ohcBJus&t=690s)
7. Mechanistic interpretability is the single most important missing breakthrough for making AI reliably safe and controllable [▶ 25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7F6ohcBJus&t=1535s)
8. AI is "uniquely well-suited to autocracy" through individualized propaganda, surveillance, cyber attacks, and drone armies, making chip export controls essential [▶ 13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7F6ohcBJus&t=837s)
9. Claude Cowork (a non-coding version of Claude Code) was built in a week and a half almost entirely with Claude Opus, and achieved 4x engagement metrics within a day of release [▶ 5:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7F6ohcBJus&t=300s)
10. Government will need to play a role in redistributing AI-driven growth; ideological resistance to this will collapse as the technology's impact becomes undeniable [▶ 8:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7F6ohcBJus&t=532s)

## Notable Quotes
> "We basically have a Moore's law for intelligence, where the model is getting more and more cognitively capable every few months. And that march has just been constant." - Dario Amodei [▶ 1:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7F6ohcBJus&t=109s)

> "The idea that we could have 5% or 10% GDP growth, but also, you know, 10% unemployment, it's not logically inconsistent at all. It's just never happened that way before." - Dario Amodei [▶ 4:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7F6ohcBJus&t=259s)

> "I have some engineers, some engineering leads within Anthropic who have basically said to me, I don't write any code anymore. I just let Opus do the work and I edit it." - Dario Amodei [▶ 4:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7F6ohcBJus&t=291s)

> "Software is going to become cheap, maybe essentially free. The premise that you need to amortize a piece of software you build across millions of users, that may start to be false." - Dario Amodei [▶ 5:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7F6ohcBJus&t=333s)

> "I am concerned that AI may be uniquely well-suited to autocracy and to deepening the repression that we see in autocracies." - Dario Amodei [▶ 13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7F6ohcBJus&t=837s)

> "The nightmare would be that there's like this emerging zeroth world country of like 10 million people that's like 7 million people in the Bay, in like Silicon Valley... Maybe the 10 percent GDP growth looks like 50 percent GDP growth in that part." - Dario Amodei [▶ 29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7F6ohcBJus&t=1788s)

> "We're going to find that ideology will not survive the nature of this technology. It won't survive reality... they're going to become bipartisan and universal because everyone will recognize the necessity of it. Just mark my words." - Dario Amodei [▶ 31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7F6ohcBJus&t=1892s)

> "Scientists, there's a long tradition of scientists thinking about the effects of the technology they build, of thinking of themselves as having responsibility for the technology they build, not ducking responsibility." - Dario Amodei [▶ 23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7F6ohcBJus&t=1395s)

- **Moore's Law for Intelligence**: AI capabilities are improving on a smooth exponential curve, while public sentiment oscillates wildly every 3-6 months between hype and bubble fears [▶ 1:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7F6ohcBJus&t=109s)
- **Economic Disruption & Inequality**: The unprecedented combination of high GDP growth and high unemployment, with whole careers potentially disappearing while productivity surges [▶ 4:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7F6ohcBJus&t=259s)

- **Claude Cowork Launch**: Non-technical users were wrestling with the CLI to use Claude Code's agentic capabilities, revealing massive unmet demand; Claude Cowork built in two weeks using Claude itself [▶ 17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7F6ohcBJus&t=1077s)
- **Anthropic Economic Index**: A real-time tracking tool measuring how Claude is used across tasks, industries, and geographies, intended to inform policy before it goes blind [▶ 6:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7F6ohcBJus&t=406s)

- **No Image/Video Generation**: Anthropic intentionally avoids generating photos and videos, viewing the consumer content market as prone to slop, fakery, and addiction [▶ 21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7F6ohcBJus&t=1273s)
- **Scientists vs. Entrepreneurs**: AI companies led by scientists (Amodei, Hassabis) think about responsibility differently from those led by social media entrepreneurs [▶ 23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7F6ohcBJus&t=1395s)

- **Global AI Inequality**: The "zeroth world" nightmare scenario where ~10M people in Silicon Valley decouple from the rest of the economy; Anthropic working with Gates Foundation and Rwanda Ministry of Education [▶ 29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7F6ohcBJus&t=1788s)

## Summary
In this interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei delivers a wide-ranging assessment of AI's trajectory and its societal implications. He describes AI progress as following a "Moore's law for intelligence" -- a smooth exponential that public opinion alternately hypes and dismisses every few months. His central economic thesis is that AI will produce a historically unprecedented combination of very high GDP growth (5-10%) alongside high unemployment and inequality, a scenario that has no precedent and that society is wholly unprepared for.

On the business side, Amodei reveals Anthropic's explosive revenue trajectory -- roughly $0 to $100M in 2023, $100M to $1B in 2024, and $1B to $10B in 2025. He attributes the current "moment" for Claude to the inflection point reached by Claude Opus 4.5 in AI coding, noting that some Anthropic engineering leads have stopped writing code entirely. The launch of Claude Cowork, a non-coding interface for agentic tasks built in just two weeks using Claude itself, achieved 4x the engagement metrics of any prior release within a day.

On safety and geopolitics, Amodei identifies mechanistic interpretability as the single most important unsolved problem for making AI controllable, comparing it to brain scanning versus simply talking to a patient. He expresses grave concern about AI in the hands of autocracies, warning about individualized propaganda, universal surveillance, and autonomous drone armies. He advocates strongly for chip export controls as the most effective policy lever.

The interview closes with Amodei's warning about a potential "zeroth world" scenario where AI's benefits concentrate in a tiny Silicon Valley enclave while leaving the rest of the world behind. He predicts that ideological resistance to government redistribution of AI-generated growth will collapse within one to two years as the technology's impact becomes undeniable, declaring: "Just mark my words."
