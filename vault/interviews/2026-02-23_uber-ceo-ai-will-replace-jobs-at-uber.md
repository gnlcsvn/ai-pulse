# Uber CEO: I Have To Be Honest, AI Will Replace 9.4 Million Jobs At Uber

## Guests
- **Dara Khosrowshahi** - CEO, Uber

## Key Takeaways
1. AI will be able to replace 70-80% of intellectual jobs within the next 10 years, with physical jobs (driving, robotics) following in 15-20 years due to the greater complexity and capital requirements of operating in the physical world [▶ 76:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s52O1JH2tnU&t=4596s)
2. Uber has 9.5 million drivers and couriers on its platform -- the largest organizer of flexible work globally, with the second largest workforce being the Chinese Army -- and Khosrowshahi envisions the majority of trips being fulfilled by autonomous robots in 15-20 years [▶ 84:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s52O1JH2tnU&t=5045s)
3. 90% of Uber's coders are using AI tools, with 30% being power users who show clear differentiation in productivity via code diffs, fundamentally changing the role from writing code to orchestrating agents [▶ 79:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s52O1JH2tnU&t=4741s)
4. The moment AI models can learn in real time (not just through periodic retraining cycles), that is the point at which "we are all replaceable" -- and Khosrowshahi says he has not yet seen a model that can do this [▶ 82:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s52O1JH2tnU&t=4928s)
5. Every universal basic income experiment has failed, because work provides meaning and self-worth that government payments cannot replicate -- the loss of purpose, not income, is the real threat of job displacement [▶ 89:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s52O1JH2tnU&t=5366s)
6. Uber has launched "Uber AI Solutions" to extend the platform beyond driving and delivery into knowledge-based work, allowing workers to train AI agents and do other tasks on their phones [▶ 86:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s52O1JH2tnU&t=5212s)
7. Society's ability to retrain large groups of people at scale is the critical missing capability -- Khosrowshahi sees no country currently investing in this "retraining machine" and identifies it as the single most important intervention [▶ 94:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s52O1JH2tnU&t=5683s)
8. Uber was built on an AI core from the start -- pricing, routing, matching, batching are all driven by small AI models trained on local problems and stitched together, processing 40 million trips per day [▶ 75:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s52O1JH2tnU&t=4509s)
9. Job displacement will not be a major issue in the next 5 years, but beyond 5 years it becomes a significant societal challenge, because the pace of technological change is outstripping society's ability to adjust [▶ 88:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s52O1JH2tnU&t=5290s)
10. Khosrowshahi turned Uber from losing $2.5-3 billion per year to generating $9.8 billion in free cash flow, and credits relentless execution, transparency, and a culture of continuous improvement [▶ 59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s52O1JH2tnU&t=3580s)

## Topics Discussed
- **AI Job Displacement (70-80% of Jobs)**: Khosrowshahi states bluntly that AI will be able to replace 70-80% of intellectual work within 10 years, and physical jobs in 15-20 years. He acknowledges this is a real question for society, particularly because the pace of change may outstrip society's ability to retrain workers [▶ 76:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s52O1JH2tnU&t=4596s)
- **Autonomous Vehicles & Waymo Partnership**: Uber partners with Waymo in Austin and Atlanta. Khosrowshahi confirms autonomous driving is already safer than human driving. He envisions the majority of Uber trips being completed by robots in 15-20 years but notes that physical AI requires more time due to regulations, capital, and physical-world complexity [▶ 84:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s52O1JH2tnU&t=5045s)
- **Uber's AI Core**: The entire company is built on small AI models trained on local problems and stitched together -- pricing, routing, matching, batching -- processing 40 million trips daily across cities as different as New York and Lagos [▶ 75:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s52O1JH2tnU&t=4509s)
- **Coding Automation at Uber**: 90% of engineers use AI tools, with 30% being power users showing measurably higher productivity. Khosrowshahi sees the coding profession shifting from writing code to orchestrating agents. Currently he would hire more engineers with efficiency gains, but in ~5 years he may invest in agents and GPUs instead [▶ 79:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s52O1JH2tnU&t=4741s)
- **Real-Time Learning as the Tipping Point**: Khosrowshahi identifies real-time learning (not periodic retraining) as the capability that would make humans truly replaceable. Current models learn through version jumps (3.5 to 3.8) rather than continuous learning from experience [▶ 82:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s52O1JH2tnU&t=4928s)
- **Universal Basic Income Failures**: Every UBI test has shown worse outcomes for recipients, because work provides meaning and self-worth that money alone cannot replace. Khosrowshahi connects this to his own father's experience of losing purpose after losing his career [▶ 89:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s52O1JH2tnU&t=5366s)
- **The Retraining Challenge**: Society lacks the capability to retrain large groups of people at scale. Khosrowshahi identifies building a "retraining machine" as the single most important intervention governments could make, and notes he does not see any country investing in this [▶ 94:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s52O1JH2tnU&t=5683s)
- **Uber AI Solutions**: A new Uber team extending the platform beyond driving and delivery into knowledge-based work, allowing workers to train AI agents and do various tasks on their phones [▶ 86:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s52O1JH2tnU&t=5212s)
- **Jevons Paradox & Market Expansion**: Khosrowshahi describes Uber as a product of Jevons paradox -- by radically improving convenience and reducing cost, the total addressable market expanded far beyond the original black car and taxi industries [▶ 33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s52O1JH2tnU&t=2035s)
- **"Dara AI"**: Some Uber teams have built an internal AI model of Khosrowshahi that they use to rehearse presentations before pitching to the real CEO [▶ 81:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s52O1JH2tnU&t=4882s)
- **Leadership & Transparency**: Khosrowshahi advocates radical transparency as a CEO -- telling the truth to employees creates a culture where they tell the truth back. He learned this from Barry Diller and deliberately bypasses organizational layers by meeting with engineers four levels down [▶ 59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s52O1JH2tnU&t=3580s)
- **Work Ethic as the Most Important Skill**: Khosrowshahi argues that working hard is a learned skill and the single most important predictor of success, more important than talent, domain expertise, or career planning [▶ 51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s52O1JH2tnU&t=3108s)

## Summary
In this wide-ranging interview with Steven Bartlett on The Diary of a CEO, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi delivers a strikingly honest assessment of AI's impact on the workforce, autonomous vehicles, and Uber's future. His central claim is stark: AI will be capable of replacing 70-80% of intellectual jobs within 10 years, with physical jobs (including driving) following in 15-20 years. With 9.5 million drivers and couriers on Uber's platform -- making it the largest organizer of flexible work globally -- the implications are enormous. He envisions the majority of Uber trips being completed by robots in 15-20 years, with the company's 9 million human workers potentially replaced by 20 million autonomous vehicles.

On coding and AI adoption within Uber, Khosrowshahi reveals that 90% of the company's engineers use AI tools, with 30% qualifying as power users who show measurably higher code output. He sees the profession evolving from writing code to orchestrating AI agents, and anticipates that within 5 years, Uber may stop adding human engineers and instead invest in agents and GPUs. He identifies the critical tipping point for full human replaceability as the moment AI models can learn in real time, rather than through periodic version-to-version retraining -- a capability he says no current model possesses.

Khosrowshahi is notably skeptical of universal basic income as a solution to AI-driven job displacement, pointing out that every UBI experiment has produced worse outcomes for recipients. Drawing on his own father's devastating experience of losing his career and identity after fleeing Iran's Islamic Revolution, he argues that work provides meaning and self-worth that money cannot substitute. The real challenge, he says, is building a societal "retraining machine" capable of redeploying large populations at scale -- a capability that no country is currently investing in. He does not think job displacement will be a major issue in the next 5 years, but beyond that horizon, it becomes a serious societal problem.

The interview also covers Khosrowshahi's remarkable personal and professional journey -- from fleeing Iran at age nine, to investment banking at Allen & Company, to a 12-year run as Expedia CEO that grew revenue from $2.1B to $8.8B, to turning Uber from a $3B-per-year loss-maker into a company generating $9.8 billion in free cash flow. Throughout, he emphasizes transparency, relentless execution, and the learned skill of working hard as the foundations of his leadership philosophy. The conversation also touches on Uber's Waymo partnership for autonomous vehicles, its new "Uber AI Solutions" platform for knowledge work, the internal "Dara AI" teams use to rehearse presentations, and Daniel Ek's pivotal advice that convinced him to leave Expedia for the challenge of Uber.
