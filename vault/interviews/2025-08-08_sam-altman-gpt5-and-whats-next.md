# Sam Altman Shows Me GPT 5... And What's Next

## Guests
- **Sam Altman** - CEO, OpenAI
- **Cleo Abram** - Host, Huge Conversations (interviewer)

## Key Takeaways
1. GPT-5 represents a leap in coding ability -- Altman says it can write on-demand, nearly instantaneous software and that this is the defining element of the GPT-5 era [▶ 9:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmtuvNfytjM&t=562s)
2. For the first time, Altman feels he can ask any hard scientific or technical question and get a pretty good answer from GPT-5 [▶ 4:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmtuvNfytjM&t=285s)
3. Altman bets that by late 2027 most people will agree an AI has made a significant new scientific discovery [▶ 11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmtuvNfytjM&t=703s)
4. His definition of superintelligence: a system that can do better AI research than the whole OpenAI research team and run the company better than he can [▶ 13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmtuvNfytjM&t=821s)
5. Energy is currently the biggest limiting factor for AI compute buildout, followed by processing and memory chips [▶ 27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmtuvNfytjM&t=1620s)
6. OpenAI released GPT OSS, an open-source model as smart as O4 mini that runs locally on a laptop -- a capability Altman says he would have predicted was many years away [▶ 29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmtuvNfytjM&t=1752s)
7. The worst safety issue at ChatGPT was sycophancy -- the model being too flattering to users and encouraging delusions in people with fragile mental states [▶ 52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmtuvNfytjM&t=3132s)
8. Altman envisions GPT-5 becoming an integrated daily companion -- connected to calendar, Gmail, proactively surfacing information, and eventually embedded in consumer devices [▶ 57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmtuvNfytjM&t=3475s)
9. He believes it is now possible for a one-person company to be worth more than a billion dollars, thanks to AI tools [▶ 23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmtuvNfytjM&t=1417s)
10. Altman says something fundamental about the social contract may need to change, particularly around how access to AGI compute is distributed [▶ 43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmtuvNfytjM&t=2639s)

## Summary
In this hour-long interview on Cleo Abram's "Huge Conversations" series, Sam Altman discusses GPT-5's capabilities and OpenAI's roadmap toward superintelligence. The interview is structured as a series of "time travel" jumps into the future, exploring what AI might mean for different aspects of life. Altman identifies GPT-5's coding ability as its most transformative feature -- the model can generate working software in seconds, making on-demand instantaneous software creation the defining element of this era. He also highlights dramatic improvements in writing quality and scientific/technical reasoning.

On the path to superintelligence, Altman defines it as a system that could outperform OpenAI's entire research team and run the company better than he can. He bets that by late 2027, most people will agree AI has made a significant scientific discovery, and frames the progress through AI's mathematical trajectory -- from solving problems that take professionals seconds, to earning an IMO gold medal on problems that take 1.5 hours each, with the next goal being thousand-hour-equivalent breakthroughs. He reveals that GPT-4.5 (codenamed Orion) was a misstep -- they built too large a model and failed to internalize that reasoning-based scaling offered steeper returns.

The conversation turns to societal impact, where Altman expresses genuine uncertainty about what the transition will feel like. He says some classes of jobs will totally disappear, but he is more worried about displaced 62-year-olds than 22-year-olds, who he calls "the luckiest kids in all of history" for the creative tools now available to them. He suggests the social contract may need to fundamentally change, particularly around distributing access to AGI compute, and draws an analogy to the transistor -- foundational but eventually invisible, with the real value created by those who build on top. On safety, he candidly admits that the worst issue ChatGPT faced was sycophancy, not the biosecurity threats they had been primarily focused on, calling it a wake-up call about unknown unknowns at scale. The interview concludes with Altman's personal origin story and his number one piece of advice: just use the tools.
