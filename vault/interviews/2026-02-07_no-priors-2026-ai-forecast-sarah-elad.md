# No Priors Ep. 144 | The 2026 AI Forecast with Sarah & Elad

## Guests
- **Sarah Guo** - Partner, Greylock (co-host of No Priors)
- **Elad Gil** - Investor, entrepreneur (co-host of No Priors)

Plus guest predictions from friends of the show recorded as short video segments.

## Key Takeaways
1. Traditionally slow technology adopters (physicians, lawyers, accountants) are enthusiastically adopting AI, which is a massively under-discussed signal [▶ 5:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOsNrV3bXtQ&t=319s)
2. The next wave of AI verticals will consolidate at massive scale in 2026, following the pattern of coding, medical scribing, and legal in 2025 [▶ 3:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOsNrV3bXtQ&t=210s)
3. AI foundation models for physics, materials science, and math will produce breakthrough one-off results that get overhyped in the short term but are understated long-term [▶ 7:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOsNrV3bXtQ&t=427s)
4. Sentiment around robotics companies will collapse in 2026 as some fail to deliver on projected timelines, even though the field will continue to progress [▶ 7:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOsNrV3bXtQ&t=442s)
5. Self-driving will be one of the biggest trends of 2026, both for personal vehicles and ride-hailing (Waymo, Tesla) [▶ 11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOsNrV3bXtQ&t=708s)
6. The most likely global winners in robotics will be a subset of Chinese companies plus Tesla plus possibly one startup [▶ 9:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOsNrV3bXtQ&t=561s)
7. AI IPOs will surge in 2026 driven by massive retail appetite to participate in AI beyond NVIDIA [▶ 16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOsNrV3bXtQ&t=968s)
8. Consumer AI agent software will finally start to deliver magical, differentiated experiences in 2026 [▶ 17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOsNrV3bXtQ&t=1030s)

10. Code is a bootstrap into faster AGI development; code plus self-evolution may be the path to rapid capability liftoff [▶ 26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOsNrV3bXtQ&t=1572s)

## Notable Quotes
> "I think this is, by the way, super under discussed that the people who have tended to be the slowest adopters of technology love AI. That's physicians, that's lawyers, that's certain accounting types." - Elad Gil [▶ 5:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOsNrV3bXtQ&t=319s)

> "The reality of the technology always take like 10 years to propagate and people are getting enormous value out of the AI already and they're going to get way more out of it in the future." - Elad Gil [▶ 3:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOsNrV3bXtQ&t=185s)

> "I think we're going to see somebody make a lot of money, hundreds of millions of dollars, trading markets with LLMs next year. It's inevitable." - Sarah Guo [▶ 1:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOsNrV3bXtQ&t=76s)

> "The most likely global winners in robotics will be some subset of China plus Tesla plus something else, right? Maybe one of the startups." - Elad Gil [▶ 9:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOsNrV3bXtQ&t=561s)

## Summary
Sarah Guo and Elad Gil deliver their annual 2026 AI forecast, covering the full landscape from foundation models to robotics to market dynamics. The episode opens with Sarah's bold prediction that someone will make hundreds of millions of dollars trading markets with LLMs, setting the tone for a prediction-dense conversation.

Elad leads with structural observations: AI bubble narratives will recur despite accelerating adoption, the next wave of AI verticals will consolidate at massive scale, and foundation models for physics and materials science will produce overhyped but ultimately transformative breakthroughs. He emphasizes a strikingly under-discussed trend -- that traditionally conservative professions like medicine, law, and accounting are among AI's fastest adopters.

The robotics discussion reveals a nuanced view. Sarah predicts sentiment collapse around some robotics companies in 2026 as timelines slip, even as the field progresses. Elad argues self-driving is the biggest near-term robotics story and predicts Tesla Optimus plus Chinese companies will likely dominate, though both agree startups have opportunity. On the market side, they expect a wave of AI IPOs driven by insatiable retail demand, with hedge funds feeling compelled to participate regardless of fundamentals.

Consumer AI emerges as a major theme, with Sarah expressing genuine excitement about novel consumer agent software she has personally experienced, while predicting consumer AI hardware will mostly fail. Elad notes a puzzling dearth of consumer AI innovation despite two years of powerful models, attributing it partly to a limited pool of great consumer product people and partly to intimidation by incumbents.

The episode concludes with guest predictions spanning reasoning systems revolutionizing all industries, enterprise AI agents becoming dominant, the US regaining open-weight model leadership, AI becoming politicized in midterm elections, AI drug discovery entering deployment, energy efficiency becoming critical for data centers, and knowledge work broadly experiencing the same AI-driven transformation that software engineering underwent.
