# Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis: AI's Next Breakthroughs, AGI Timeline, Google AI Glasses

## Guests
- **Demis Hassabis** - CEO, Google DeepMind

## Key Takeaways
1. AGI requires one or two more major breakthroughs beyond current LLMs, specifically in continual learning, efficient memory, and long-term reasoning and planning [▶ 2:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgBfobN2A7A&t=124s)
2. Hassabis estimates AGI is five to ten years away and defines it as a system that can exhibit all cognitive capabilities humans can, including highest-level creativity and physical intelligence [▶ 8:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgBfobN2A7A&t=531s)
3. Video generation models like Veo represent steps toward world models that understand physics and causality, which Hassabis considers essential for AGI [▶ 10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgBfobN2A7A&t=605s)
4. Google AI glasses with partners Warby Parker, Gentle Monster, and Samsung could arrive by summer 2026, with the killer app being a universal digital assistant [▶ 14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgBfobN2A7A&t=872s)
5. Hassabis firmly rejects Sam Altman's claim that we have "whooshed by AGI," calling it an attempt to turn AGI into a marketing term [▶ 6:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgBfobN2A7A&t=419s)
6. Google has no current plans to put ads in the Gemini app, and Hassabis questions why competitors claiming AGI is imminent would bother with advertising [▶ 16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgBfobN2A7A&t=990s)
7. Hassabis praised Claude Code and Anthropic's coding capabilities, while highlighting Google's own "Anti-Gravity" IDE and Gemini 3's strengths in front-end work [▶ 18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgBfobN2A7A&t=1128s)
8. AI will be the most transformative technology in human history, with a "huge capability overhang" in what current models can already do [▶ 21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgBfobN2A7A&t=1290s)
9. The AI bubble is not binary -- parts of the industry are frothy (seed rounds of tens of billions for companies with no product), while established companies like Alphabet are well-positioned either way [▶ 22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgBfobN2A7A&t=1356s)
10. Hassabis's philosophical view: information, not energy or matter, is the most fundamental unit of the universe, and AI helps us navigate information landscapes to solve intractable problems [▶ 27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgBfobN2A7A&t=1673s)

## Notable Quotes
> "I'm definitely a subscriber to the idea that maybe we need one or two more big breakthroughs before we'll get to AGI. And I think there are along the lines of things like continual learning, better memory, longer context windows, or perhaps more efficient context windows." - Demis Hassabis [▶ 2:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgBfobN2A7A&t=124s)

> "I don't think AGI should be sort of turned into a marketing term or for commercial gain. I think there is always been a scientific definition of that. My definition of that is a system that can exhibit all the cognitive capabilities humans can. And I mean all." - Demis Hassabis [▶ 6:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgBfobN2A7A&t=419s)

> "Today's systems, in my opinion, are nowhere near that. Doesn't matter how many Erdos problems you solve... I think it's far, far from what a true invention or someone like a Ramanujan would have been able to do." - Demis Hassabis [▶ 8:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgBfobN2A7A&t=486s)

> "I think the killer app is universal digital assistant that's with you, helping you in your everyday life. And they're available to you on any surface, on your computer, on your browser, on your phone, but also on devices like glasses." - Demis Hassabis [▶ 13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgBfobN2A7A&t=827s)

> "I think actions speak louder than words going back to the original conversation we were having with Sam and others claiming AGI is around the corner. Why would you bother with ads then?" - Demis Hassabis [▶ 16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgBfobN2A7A&t=975s)

> "It's clearly going to be the most transformative technology in human history. There's maybe a question mark about timelines. Is it two years or five years? I mean, either way, it's very soon for something this transformative." - Demis Hassabis [▶ 21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgBfobN2A7A&t=1273s)

> "It's like the industrial revolution, maybe 10X of that, but we'll have to adapt again. And I think we'll find new meaning and things." - Demis Hassabis [▶ 27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgBfobN2A7A&t=1627s)

> "I think information is really the right way to understand the universe. If you think of biology and living systems, we're information systems that are resisting entropy." - Demis Hassabis [▶ 28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgBfobN2A7A&t=1686s)

## Summary
In this interview from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis provides a wide-ranging assessment of the state of AI and the path to AGI. He firmly pushes back against suggestions that AI progress was stalling, noting that DeepMind has consistently seen improvements across pre-training, post-training, and reasoning paradigms. However, he believes one or two more fundamental breakthroughs -- particularly in continual learning, efficient memory, and long-term planning -- are needed before AGI can be achieved. He estimates this is five to ten years away.

Hassabis offers a rigorous definition of AGI that stands in stark contrast to Sam Altman's more permissive framing: true AGI must exhibit all human cognitive capabilities, including Einstein-level scientific theory creation, Picasso-level artistic innovation, and physical intelligence on par with elite athletes. He explicitly rejects Altman's suggestion that AGI has been "whooshed by" and should not be used as a marketing term. He highlights video generation models like Veo as important steps toward world models that could eventually enable the long-term planning required for AGI.

On the product side, Hassabis reveals significant personal involvement in Google's AI glasses initiative, with partnerships with Warby Parker, Gentle Monster, and Samsung expected to produce consumer products potentially by summer 2026. He sees the universal digital assistant as the killer app that previous smart glasses lacked. He also praises Anthropic's Claude Code while positioning Google's own Anti-Gravity IDE and Gemini 3 as strong competitors, particularly in front-end development.

The conversation touches on AI business dynamics, with Hassabis pointing out the contradiction of companies claiming AGI is imminent while pursuing advertising business models. He confirms Google has no current plans for ads in Gemini. On the AI bubble question, he takes a nuanced position: some parts of the AI industry are clearly overheated, but established companies like Alphabet are positioned to win regardless of market conditions. He closes with a philosophical reflection on information as the universe's most fundamental unit, connecting it to how AI systems like AlphaFold navigate information landscapes to solve previously intractable scientific problems.
