# Conversation with Alex Karp, CEO and Co-Founder, Palantir Technologies

## Guests
- **Alex Karp** - CEO & Co-Founder, Palantir Technologies
- **Larry Fink** - CEO, BlackRock (interviewer)

## Key Takeaways
1. Military AI deployments in Ukraine, Israel, and the US have proven that software-based defense works in real battlefield conditions, contradicting widespread prior skepticism [▶ 5:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fqxZKdb3J0&t=301s)
2. The biggest hidden value of enterprise AI is exposing that large parts of organizations do not actually function as assumed -- "whole pieces of the enterprise exist on a PowerPoint that when you go to battle, you will find out do not exist" [▶ 8:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fqxZKdb3J0&t=536s)
3. Defense-to-commercial AI transfer is "almost one-to-one translatable" because battlefield conditions provide ground truth about what actually works [▶ 14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fqxZKdb3J0&t=892s)
4. Off-the-shelf LLMs alone cannot solve regulated enterprise problems like underwriting or hospital intake; you need an orchestration layer (ontology) that maps LLM output to enterprise-specific language [▶ 19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fqxZKdb3J0&t=1183s)
5. Palantir can remove up to 80% of costs in areas they deploy while dramatically improving top-line performance [▶ 24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fqxZKdb3J0&t=1467s)
6. AI deployment speed has compressed from one year to one week over the past five years [▶ 24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fqxZKdb3J0&t=1481s)
7. Vocational and technical workers will become more valuable in the AI era, while traditional white-collar roles face displacement; aptitude testing needs to be rethought [▶ 25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fqxZKdb3J0&t=1542s)
8. Europe's tech adoption is a "serious and very structural problem" with no political leader stepping up to acknowledge it [▶ 31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fqxZKdb3J0&t=1870s)
9. AI acts as a "pen test" on societies and organizations -- those that can bear the load gain huge advantages, while those pretending to bear loads they cannot will collapse [▶ 31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fqxZKdb3J0&t=1913s)
10. The US and China are both succeeding at AI at scale, albeit with different approaches, and their acceleration will exceed what most people believe is possible [▶ 29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fqxZKdb3J0&t=1785s)

## Notable Quotes
> "One of the most important things Palantir has done on the battlefield is be able to make up for the fact that half your enterprise doesn't even work on the battlefield. It does work in a lab, on a PowerPoint, only built by country." - Alex Karp [▶ 8:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fqxZKdb3J0&t=536s)

> "The fact that it's basically a purely raw, naked environment means that you actually know the ground truth of what could work, independent of what enterprises think can work." - Alex Karp [▶ 14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fqxZKdb3J0&t=892s)

> "If you just buy large language models off the shelf and try to do any of this, it won't work. It's a commodity." - Alex Karp [▶ 19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fqxZKdb3J0&t=1183s)

> "I think that is very likely to accelerate way beyond what most people believe is possible. Like the discount rate, I think, not in the short term, but in the long term, is way too high on what will be done and how this will impact every aspect of our society." - Alex Karp [▶ 29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fqxZKdb3J0&t=1797s)

> "The tech adoption in Europe is a serious and very, very structural problem. And what scares me the most is I haven't seen any political leader just stand up and say, we have a serious and structural problem that we are going to fix." - Alex Karp [▶ 31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fqxZKdb3J0&t=1870s)

> "One way to look at the unfairness of AI is it pen tests, meaning it load bears on things. So, societies that can bear that load have a huge advantage." - Alex Karp [▶ 31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fqxZKdb3J0&t=1913s)

> "The revolution that's coming is going to expose the actual market value of what you're doing. Whether we want it or not." - Alex Karp [▶ 33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fqxZKdb3J0&t=2004s)

> "Next three years, you're just going to get market value honesty in all sorts of communities and micro communities." - Alex Karp [▶ 33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fqxZKdb3J0&t=2024s)

- **Developing World**: AI will create pockets of success and failure; the key factor is whether a society's institutions can "load bear" the stress testing AI brings [▶ 31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fqxZKdb3J0&t=1913s)

## Summary
At the World Economic Forum 2026 annual meeting in Davos, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink interviewed Palantir CEO Alex Karp in a wide-ranging conversation covering AI's role in defense, enterprise, and society. Karp opened by explaining how software-based defense technology was long dismissed by adversaries as an American marketing gimmick, but has now been proven on real battlefields in Ukraine, Israel, and US operations. He gave detailed examples of the complexity involved in Ukraine's drone operations -- from data synchronization and asset protection to countering Russian electronic jamming -- emphasizing that each theater of war presents unique, dynamic challenges.

Karp drew a direct line from battlefield AI to commercial applications, arguing the transfer is "almost one-to-one." He described how Palantir's ontology layer enables hospitals to process patient intake 10-15x faster and enterprises to cut up to 80% of costs, while also bolstering civil liberties by creating transparent, auditable decision trails. He was sharply critical of the approach of simply buying off-the-shelf LLMs, calling them commodities that cannot handle regulated environments without a structured orchestration layer.

On the workforce, Karp pushed back against the narrative that AI will destroy jobs, instead arguing that vocational and technical workers will become more valuable. He cited the example of a former police officer with a junior college education who is now irreplaceable running Palantir's MAVEN targeting system for the US Army. He suggested new methods of aptitude testing are needed to surface hidden talent.

Looking at global dynamics, Karp expressed deep concern about Europe's structural tech adoption failure, noting no political leader is willing to acknowledge the problem. He described AI as a "pen test" on societies -- those with genuine institutional capacity will thrive, while those relying on hollow structures will be exposed. He predicted that within the next three years, AI will force "market value honesty" across every community, and that the long-term impact of AI on US and Chinese economies will far exceed current expectations.
