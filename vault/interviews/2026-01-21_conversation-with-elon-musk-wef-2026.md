## Summary
In a 35-minute fireside chat at the World Economic Forum's 2026 Annual Meeting in Davos, Elon Musk sat down with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink to discuss the future of AI, robotics, energy, and space. Fink opened by highlighting Tesla's extraordinary 43% compounded return since its IPO, setting the stage for a wide-ranging conversation about Musk's vision for the future of civilization.

Musk made several bold predictions about artificial intelligence, stating that AI could surpass any individual human in intelligence by the end of 2026, with "no later than next year" as his outer bound. Looking further ahead, he predicted that by 2030 or 2031, AI would be smarter than all of humanity collectively. On the robotics front, he shared that Tesla Optimus robots are already performing simple tasks in Tesla factories, with more complex industrial tasks expected by year-end 2026 and public sales of humanoid robots targeted for the end of 2027. His long-term vision is for billions of humanoid robots, eventually outnumbering humans, which he says would create "an explosion in the global economy" that is "truly beyond all precedent."

A major theme of the conversation was energy as the critical bottleneck for AI progress. Musk emphasized that while AI chip production is increasing exponentially, US electricity generation is only growing 3-4% per year, meaning the industry will soon produce "more chips than we can turn on." He contrasted this with China's aggressive energy buildout, including 1,500 GW/year of solar manufacturing capacity and 100 GW of nuclear under construction. He announced that both SpaceX and Tesla are independently working to build 100 GW/year of solar manufacturing capacity in the US within about three years, and noted that a mere 100-by-100-mile solar installation could power the entire United States.

On space, Musk revealed that SpaceX hopes to achieve full Starship reusability in 2026, which would reduce the cost of space access by a factor of 100, to under $100 per pound. He made the striking claim that within 2-3 years, space would become the lowest-cost location for AI data centers, thanks to continuous solar power (5x more effective than on Earth), natural cooling at 3 degrees Kelvin, and the unlimited real estate of space. SpaceX plans to begin launching solar-powered AI satellites within a few years. Musk also touched on longevity research, expressing confidence that reversing aging is "highly likely" to be achieved, and closed with his personal philosophy: "It is actually better to err on the side of being an optimist and wrong rather than a pessimist and right."
