## Key Takeaways
1. AI has "reinvented the computer" and the new computer is far better than what we have been building on for the last 50+ years [▶ 0:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kdql4I-NJ0M&t=15s)
2. There is no problem that a16z can think of that AI will not be able to solve, from cancer to transportation to fraud [▶ 16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kdql4I-NJ0M&t=978s)
3. The number of entrepreneurs will multiply because the ease of going from an idea to a fantastic product will be much simpler, since AI is best at building stuff [▶ 17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kdql4I-NJ0M&t=1027s)
4. Cloud software companies are consistently 10x bigger than their on-premise predecessors (Salesforce vs. Siebel, Workday vs. PeopleSoft), and AI will expand markets even further [▶ 10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kdql4I-NJ0M&t=617s)
5. Supply-side breakthroughs unlock markets 10x, 100x, or 1,000x larger than existing ones, and this will be the single dominant trend in investing for the next 30 years [▶ 19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kdql4I-NJ0M&t=1177s)
6. The "mythical man month" no longer applies in the AI era -- you can now throw money at a technological lead and catch up, as Elon Musk demonstrated with xAI [▶ 46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kdql4I-NJ0M&t=2794s)
7. AI is on the order of the steam engine or electricity; we are going to end up in a fundamentally different and better world [▶ 50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kdql4I-NJ0M&t=3011s)
8. Zoomer founders are the best, most competent, most capable generation of founders -- AI-native, grew up online, completely unapologetic about wanting to build something great [▶ 51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kdql4I-NJ0M&t=3095s)
9. a16z raised its latest $15 billion fund almost entirely on reputation, compared to 6 months of meetings for the original $300 million fund [▶ 34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kdql4I-NJ0M&t=2065s)
10. The firm's competitive moat is reputation, which compounds over time and transfers to portfolio companies at critical growth phases [▶ 30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kdql4I-NJ0M&t=1852s)

## Topics Discussed
- **AI as a New Computer**: Ben Horowitz frames AI as a reinvention of the computer itself, arguing there is no problem it cannot solve, from cancer to fraud to transportation [▶ 15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kdql4I-NJ0M&t=958s)
- **Supply-Driven Markets**: Marc Andreessen argues that significant supply-side breakthroughs consistently unlock markets 10x-1000x larger than existing ones, and that this pattern will dominate investing for 30 years [▶ 13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kdql4I-NJ0M&t=836s)
- **The 10x Bigger Thesis**: Demonstrated through cloud vs. on-premise software (Salesforce vs. Siebel), Databricks vs. Oracle ($2 trillion), and Substack vs. traditional media [▶ 10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kdql4I-NJ0M&t=617s)
- **The Mythical Man Month Is Dead**: Ben Horowitz argues that AI has broken the long-standing software engineering principle that adding more people slows projects down -- now you can throw money at problems, as Elon Musk proved with xAI catching up to OpenAI/Anthropic [▶ 46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kdql4I-NJ0M&t=2794s)
- **a16z Fund Strategy & Reputation**: The firm raised $15B largely on reputation alone, built over 16 years from a $300M first fund. Reputation is the firm's core compounding asset [▶ 30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kdql4I-NJ0M&t=1852s)
- **a16z Culture**: Written culture document that all employees must sign; "dream builders not dream killers"; never attack a founder, technology, or company publicly; the firm exists to give founders a "power boost" [▶ 27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kdql4I-NJ0M&t=1666s)
- **Media Transformation & Substack**: Andreessen sees Substack as unlocking a supply-driven market in media, potentially 1,000x the value of existing media. Long-form podcasting proved latent demand for quality content exists [▶ 12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kdql4I-NJ0M&t=745s)
- **Freedom of Speech & New Media**: Discussion of the shift from controlled to "liberated" media, with Elon Musk's Twitter purchase and Substack as turning points [▶ 1:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kdql4I-NJ0M&t=111s)
- **Using AI as a Thought Partner**: Marc Andreessen describes his workflow of asking AI to solve problems, having it interview him on open questions, then getting its synthesized point of view [▶ 17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kdql4I-NJ0M&t=1073s)
- **Venture Capital as Art, Not Science**: The intangibles of venture capital (talent picking, project picking) are becoming more important, not less. Historical analogies to Queen Isabella funding Columbus, whaling industry financing, and movie production [▶ 42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kdql4I-NJ0M&t=2531s)
- **Zoomer Founders**: Marc Andreessen is "psyched for the zoomers" -- AI-native, grew up online, no moral guilt about success, completely unapologetic, extremely funny, and the most competent generation of founders [▶ 51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kdql4I-NJ0M&t=3095s)

## Summary
In the first episode of the Ben and Marc Show for 2026, Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz sit down with guest Packy McCormick, who recently wrote an in-depth profile of Andreessen Horowitz, to discuss the firm's worldview, culture, and outlook on the AI era. The conversation opens with the transformation of the media landscape, including the role of Substack and long-form podcasting in creating a "supply-driven market" for high-quality content that traditional media structures could not support.

The central thesis of the episode is that supply-side breakthroughs -- whether in cloud software, AI, or media -- consistently unlock markets that are 10x, 100x, or even 1,000x larger than their predecessors. Ben illustrates this with the example of Databricks, which he told would be 10x bigger than Oracle (a $2 trillion outcome), and Marc extends the pattern to Uber vs. taxis, GPUs vs. gaming, and Substack vs. legacy media. They argue this dynamic of underestimated market sizes will be the dominant trend in investing for the next 30 years.

On AI specifically, Ben Horowitz declares that "we reinvented the computer" and that there is no problem they can think of that AI will not be able to solve. He argues the "mythical man month" -- the longstanding principle that adding more engineers slows projects down -- is now dead, pointing to Elon Musk's xAI catching up to OpenAI and Anthropic by throwing money at the foundation model problem. Both see AI as comparable in magnitude to the steam engine or electricity, predicting a fundamentally different and better world.

The conversation also explores a16z's firm culture and strategy. The firm's core compounding asset is reputation, demonstrated by the contrast between raising their $300M first fund over six months of meetings versus raising $15B on the strength of one AMA each. They discuss the written culture document all employees must sign, the "dream builders not dream killers" philosophy, and the firm's organizational design as a series of small autonomous companies within a larger entity.

Marc closes by expressing his excitement about zoomer founders, whom he describes as AI-native, trained by growing up online, and refreshingly unapologetic about wanting to build great things. Ben adds that the quality of life for everyone is "about to get way, way better than it's ever been," while acknowledging the risk that rapid change could detach people from grounded purpose and belief.
