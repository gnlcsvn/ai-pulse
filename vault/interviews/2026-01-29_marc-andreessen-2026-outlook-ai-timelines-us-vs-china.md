# Marc Andreessen's 2026 Outlook: AI Timelines, US vs. China, and The Price of AI

## Guests
- **Marc Andreessen** - Co-founder & General Partner, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z)

## Key Takeaways
1. AI is the biggest technological revolution of Andreessen's lifetime, bigger than the internet, comparable to the steam engine and electricity [▶ 2:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRh2sVcNXQ8&t=120s)
2. The price of AI is falling faster than Moore's Law, with hyper-deflation of per-unit costs driving enormous demand growth [▶ 13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRh2sVcNXQ8&t=826s)
3. AI products are still "super early" and will become much more sophisticated over the next 5-10 years [▶ 8:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRh2sVcNXQ8&t=538s)
4. AI is essentially a two-horse race between the US and China, with this competition improving the US policy landscape [▶ 27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRh2sVcNXQ8&t=1662s)
5. Open source models from China (DeepSeek, Kimi, Qwen) are replicating frontier model capabilities at dramatically reduced cost and size [▶ 17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRh2sVcNXQ8&t=1029s)
6. There are approximately 1,200 AI-related bills being tracked across US states, representing a serious regulatory threat [▶ 34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRh2sVcNXQ8&t=2063s)
7. AI application companies like Cursor are not mere "GPT wrappers" but are becoming deep technology companies building their own models [▶ 52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRh2sVcNXQ8&t=3166s)
8. Consumer AI apps are monetizing at higher price points ($200-300/month tiers), which Andreessen sees as very positive [▶ 12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRh2sVcNXQ8&t=732s)
9. XAI caught up to state-of-the-art OpenAI/Anthropic levels in less than 12 months from a standing start, suggesting no permanent moat exists [▶ 55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRh2sVcNXQ8&t=3331s)
10. The internet serves as a "carrier wave" for AI, allowing it to proliferate at light speed to 5-6 billion people already online [▶ 11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRh2sVcNXQ8&t=685s)

## Notable Quotes
> "This is the biggest technological revolution of my life. And hopefully I'll see more like this in the next whatever, 30 years. But I mean, this is the big one. And just in terms of order of magnitude, this is clearly bigger than the internet. The comps on this are things like the microprocessor and the steam engine and electricity." - Marc Andreessen [▶ 1:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRh2sVcNXQ8&t=110s)

> "I'm surprised, I think, essentially on a daily basis of what I'm seeing... every day, I see a new AI research paper that just like completely floors me of some new capability, or some new discovery, or some new development that I would have never anticipated." - Marc Andreessen [▶ 7:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRh2sVcNXQ8&t=420s)

> "The price of AI is falling much faster than Moore's Law... all of the inputs into AI are on a per unit basis, the costs are collapsing. And then as a consequence, there's kind of this hyper deflation of per unit cost." - Marc Andreessen [▶ 13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRh2sVcNXQ8&t=826s)

> "AI researchers today are getting paid more than professional athletes." - Marc Andreessen [▶ 49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRh2sVcNXQ8&t=2974s)

> "Once somebody proves that it's capable, it seems to not be that hard for other people to be able to catch up, even people with far less resources." - Marc Andreessen [▶ 0:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRh2sVcNXQ8&t=24s)

> "These are trillion dollar questions, not answers." - Marc Andreessen [▶ 0:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRh2sVcNXQ8&t=19s)

> "If you run a survey or a poll of what, for example, American voters think about AI, it's just like they're all in a total panic... If you watch the revealed preferences, they're all using AI." - Marc Andreessen [▶ 1:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRh2sVcNXQ8&t=72s)

## Summary
In this 81-minute AMA session at an a16z LP meeting, Marc Andreessen delivers a sweeping assessment of the AI landscape in early 2026. He frames AI as the largest technological revolution of his lifetime, bigger than the internet, with comps to the steam engine and electricity. He traces AI's intellectual lineage from the 1943 neural network paper through decades of false starts to the ChatGPT moment, emphasizing that we are only three years into what is effectively an 80-year revolution finally delivering on its promise.

Andreessen is bullish on AI economics, noting that the price of AI is falling faster than Moore's Law, with hyper-deflation of per-unit costs creating massive elastic demand. He highlights that consumer AI apps are pushing pricing boundaries with $200-300/month tiers, and that the "tokens by the drink" model, while great for startups, is giving way to more creative value-based pricing where AI is priced relative to the human labor it replaces. He sees hundreds of billions to trillions of dollars flowing into AI infrastructure, predicting that AI chip costs will collapse within five years as NVIDIA's dominance draws competition from AMD, hyperscaler custom chips, Chinese chipmakers, and dedicated AI chip startups.

On the US-China AI race, Andreessen details the impact of DeepSeek's open-source release and the emergence of 3-6 major Chinese AI companies (DeepSeek, Qwen, Kimi/Moonshot, and others). He notes the "chase function" where open-source models replicate frontier capabilities within months, citing Kimi's replication of GPT-5 reasoning on consumer hardware. He views this competition as actually beneficial for US policy, noting that the awareness of a "two-horse race" has dramatically reduced appetite for draconian federal AI regulation, though 1,200 state-level bills remain a concern.

On the venture side, Andreessen defends a16z's multi-strategy approach, betting simultaneously on big models and small models, open source and proprietary, foundation models and applications. He highlights investments in new foundation model companies from Ilya Sutskever, Mira Murati, and Fei-Fei Li, and argues that AI application companies (like Cursor) are not mere "GPT wrappers" but are evolving into deep technology companies building their own models. He closes with observations on public sentiment, noting the gap between stated fears and revealed preferences for AI adoption, and expressing optimism that society will embrace the technology as it has with every previous revolution.
