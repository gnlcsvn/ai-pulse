# Klarna CEO: SaaS is Dead

## Guests
- **Sebastian Siemiatkowski** - Co-founder & CEO, Klarna

## Key Takeaways
1. The cost of creating software is going to zero, and the next wave of disruption will come from AI agents reducing the switching cost of data between SaaS providers [▶ 1:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7vIRAFSXmk&t=92s)
2. Klarna has shrunk from over 7,000 employees to below 3,000 (50% reduction) primarily through natural attrition, without requesting additional investment to fund its product expansion [▶ 0:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7vIRAFSXmk&t=0s)
3. SaaS companies that once traded at 20-30x price-to-sales could fall to 1-2x (utility-level multiples) as AI erodes switching costs and moats [▶ 3:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7vIRAFSXmk&t=213s)
4. Klarna is reimagining its entire tech stack as AI-native, consolidating siloed SaaS data to give AI the best possible context - this is what Siemiatkowski calls "the operating system of the bank" [▶ 8:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7vIRAFSXmk&t=506s)
5. AI is fundamentally a compression technology - all human knowledge compresses down to a few hundred gigabytes because the amount of truly novel information is surprisingly limited [▶ 60:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7vIRAFSXmk&t=3619s)
6. Enterprise data compression could dramatically reduce the need for compute, countering the bullish narrative on data center investment [▶ 63:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7vIRAFSXmk&t=3804s)
7. Siemiatkowski predicts Cursor will lose half its revenue in 2026, being outcompeted by Claude Code [▶ 54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7vIRAFSXmk&t=3257s)
8. VCs who have not personally used AI coding tools lack the skill set to evaluate AI companies they invest in [▶ 53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7vIRAFSXmk&t=3221s)
9. The future of VIP customer experience will be the human connection - AI handles the cheap, ubiquitous service while human agents become the premium, artisan offering [▶ 15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7vIRAFSXmk&t=940s)
10. Siemiatkowski would invest in Anthropic over OpenAI, viewing Claude as an "intelligent advisor" focused on honesty rather than ChatGPT's trajectory toward emotional companionship and pleasing users [▶ 56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7vIRAFSXmk&t=3397s)

## Notable Quotes
> "Cost of creating software is going down to zero. That's it. And that means that everyone will be able to generate software at any point in time. So it is a massive change." - Sebastian Siemiatkowski [▶ 1:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7vIRAFSXmk&t=92s)

> "What I'm interested in is rather somebody telling me, Sebastian, that's freaking stupid. Like, don't do that. That makes zero sense. I want an AI to tell me you're wrong, man. And I feel currently Claude is more likely to provide me less biased answers. It's trying less to please me." - Sebastian Siemiatkowski [▶ 56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7vIRAFSXmk&t=3415s)

> "Despite what we humans would like to say, the amount of true novel information and knowledge in human society is quite limited. What we see is repetitions and variations on the same themes over and over again." - Sebastian Siemiatkowski [▶ 62:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7vIRAFSXmk&t=3744s)

> "This is what I signed up for. It is stressful. It was hard as hell. But this is what I wanted. I wanted to play in this level of league." - Sebastian Siemiatkowski [▶ 0:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7vIRAFSXmk&t=34s)

> "If I meet investors today that haven't actually downloaded and tried to build something themselves, I think they don't have the skill set to make an evaluation of the company they're looking at." - Sebastian Siemiatkowski [▶ 53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7vIRAFSXmk&t=3236s)

## Topics Discussed
- **The Death of SaaS**: Software creation costs approaching zero and AI agents reducing data switching costs will compress SaaS multiples from 20-30x to potentially 1-2x price-to-sales. Siemiatkowski sees the real threat arriving when agents can migrate data between vendors with one click. [▶ 1:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7vIRAFSXmk&t=92s)
- **AI-Native Enterprise Architecture**: Klarna is shutting down SaaS dependencies and consolidating data into a unified AI-native tech stack. Siloed data across CRM, project management, and accounting tools prevents AI from having the context it needs. The "operating system of the bank" merges deterministic and probabilistic code. [▶ 8:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7vIRAFSXmk&t=506s)
- **"Company in a Box"**: Siemiatkowski prototyped a small company workspace with open-source accounting and CRM software topped with a Claude agent. The agent could bookkeep invoices and manage customer accounts, threatening both SaaS vendors and professional service firms. [▶ 6:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7vIRAFSXmk&t=393s)
- **AI Customer Service and the Human Premium**: Klarna's AI customer service did the equivalent of 600 agents' work. But the company is now building an "Uber model" where passionate Klarna customers from rural areas work part-time as customer service agents, delivering VIP human connection as a premium offering. [▶ 10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7vIRAFSXmk&t=658s)
- **Headcount Reduction via AI**: From 7,000+ to below 3,000 employees through natural attrition (~20%/year), not mass layoffs. Employee compensation grew ~50% per head during the same period. Board approved major product expansion without additional investment. [▶ 34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7vIRAFSXmk&t=2051s)
- **AI as Compression Technology**: AI compresses all human knowledge into a few hundred gigabytes because most information is repetitions and variations. This has major implications for enterprise data and compute needs. Siemiatkowski discussed this with Michael Burry, who is betting against the data center bull thesis. [▶ 60:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7vIRAFSXmk&t=3619s)
- **Anthropic vs OpenAI**: OpenAI is becoming a consumer/companion product optimizing for emotional connection ("Her" trajectory). Claude is the "intelligent advisor" that will tell you when you are wrong. Siemiatkowski would invest in Anthropic over OpenAI. [▶ 55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7vIRAFSXmk&t=3313s)
- **Klarna as Digital Financial Assistant**: A vision from 2015 - becoming a digital financial assistant that proactively saves customers time and money. Klarna has unique data advantages through its own payment rails (full digital receipts with product-level detail, not just transaction amounts). [▶ 21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7vIRAFSXmk&t=1268s)
- **Fintech Competition (Revolut, Nubank, Robinhood)**: Klarna has 110M customers vs Revolut's 65M. Siemiatkowski thinks Nubank is better positioned than Revolut for the US because Revolut is spread too thin across dozens of markets. Klarna sees itself as a "digital American Express" lifestyle brand. [▶ 22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7vIRAFSXmk&t=1363s)
- **Cursor's Decline and AI Coding Tools**: Prediction that Cursor will lose half its revenue in 2026 because Claude Code is dominating. CEOs like Mike from Atlassian are now coding at 5am. This generation makes every CEO a builder again. [▶ 54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7vIRAFSXmk&t=3257s)
- **Data Centers and Compute**: Data centers may be the most underinvested category if you believe inference will run 24/7 for most knowledge workers. But enterprise data compression could dramatically reduce compute needs - the two forces are in tension. [▶ 58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7vIRAFSXmk&t=3515s)

## Summary
Sebastian Siemiatkowski, co-founder and CEO of Klarna, delivers a sweeping thesis on why SaaS as an industry faces existential pressure. His central argument is twofold: first, the cost of software creation is approaching zero thanks to AI coding tools, and second, AI agents will soon eliminate the data switching costs that have been the true moat for enterprise software companies. He predicts SaaS multiples, historically at 20-30x price-to-sales, could compress to utility-level valuations of 1-2x. To illustrate, he describes building a "company in a box" prototype over a weekend using open-source software with a Claude agent on top that could handle accounting and CRM tasks, threatening both SaaS vendors and professional service firms.

At Klarna, Siemiatkowski has walked this talk aggressively. The company has shrunk from over 7,000 to below 3,000 employees - a 50% reduction achieved primarily through natural attrition at about 20% per year. The critical insight is that he did not request additional investment to fund the company's ambitious expansion into full-stack banking services, peer-to-peer payments, and international remittances. AI made it possible to ship more products with fewer people. Employee compensation grew roughly 50% per head during this period to share the gains. He projects headcount could fall below 2,000 by 2030. The company is rebuilding its entire tech stack as AI-native, consolidating siloed SaaS data to give AI maximum context, creating what he calls "the operating system of the bank."

One of the interview's most original contributions is Siemiatkowski's thesis on AI as a compression technology. He argues that the reason frontier models can fit on a USB stick is that the amount of truly novel human knowledge is limited - most information is repetitions and variations of the same themes. He draws an analogy to Wikipedia maintaining a single article per topic versus enterprises duplicating data across dozens of systems. This compression dynamic has major implications for the data center bull thesis: enterprise data will compress dramatically as AI eliminates redundancy, potentially reducing compute needs. He discussed this with Michael Burry, who is betting against the data center narrative, though Siemiatkowski acknowledges the counterforce of generative content creation for entertainment.

On the AI competitive landscape, Siemiatkowski is firmly in the Anthropic camp. He views OpenAI as evolving toward a consumer companion product that optimizes for emotional connection, while Claude serves as an "intelligent advisor" that provides honest, less biased feedback. He wants AI that tells him he is wrong, not one that flatters him. He predicts Cursor will lose half its revenue in 2026 to Claude Code and insists that any VC not personally building with AI coding tools lacks the competence to evaluate AI investments. Broader themes include the future of fintech competition (Klarna as a "digital American Express" with 110 million customers versus Revolut's 65 million), the transformation of customer service into a premium human offering, and an optimistic but realistic view that AI will cause significant labor disruption while potentially leading to a richer society.
