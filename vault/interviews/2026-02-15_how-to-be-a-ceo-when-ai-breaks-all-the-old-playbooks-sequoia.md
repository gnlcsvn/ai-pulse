# How to be a CEO when AI breaks all the old playbooks

## Guests
- **Brian Halligan** - Co-founder & former CEO of HubSpot; CEO Coach, Sequoia Capital. Also hosts the podcast *Long Strange Trip* and teaches "Scaling Entrepreneurial Ventures" at MIT. Part owner of the Boston Red Sox.

## Key Takeaways
1. Successful CEOs share a "perpetual state of constructive dissatisfaction" -- they never rest on past achievements and stay focused on the end state. The current generation of CEOs is notably more humble than prior generations. [▶ 4:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UyitfSbY6c&t=254s)
2. At the "adults table" (companies over 100 employees), CEOs spend roughly half their time recruiting and interviewing. Building the exec team becomes the #1 job. [▶ 6:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UyitfSbY6c&t=374s)
3. Halligan evaluates CEOs with his "LOCKS" framework: Lovable (inspires followership), Obsessed (deep founder-market fit), Chip on the shoulder, Knowledgeable (domain expertise), and Student of the game (constantly learning). [▶ 17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UyitfSbY6c&t=1030s)
4. Starting a company has never been easier, but scaling into a durable organization has never been harder. AI makes it trivial to launch, which means more competition and more noise to cut through. [▶ 26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UyitfSbY6c&t=1566s)
5. Enterprise sales will be one of the last jobs AI replaces because it requires trust between "carbon-based lifeforms." However, the top of the funnel is about to change dramatically as buyers start research in ChatGPT/Gemini/Claude rather than Google. [▶ 27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UyitfSbY6c&t=1671s)
6. There is a "massive tax on optionality" in the AI era. Planning cycles have compressed from annual to quarterly. CEOs must make faster decisions and walk through one-way doors more quickly. [▶ 36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UyitfSbY6c&t=2198s)
7. The "Halliganisms" are battle-tested operating principles: don't nibble a shit sandwich (make hard cuts all at once), never waste a good crisis, assign a single DRI for every initiative ("if you want to kill a plant, have two people water it"), and prioritize EV > TV > MEV (enterprise value over team value over personal value). [▶ 38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UyitfSbY6c&t=2309s)
8. Hire "spiky" candidates with clear strengths (and weaknesses) over well-rounded ones who score a 3/4 across the board. Blind references matter far more than interviews. [▶ 10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UyitfSbY6c&t=649s)
9. HubSpot shifted from employee-centric to customer-centric, sacrificing points on employee NPS to improve customer NPS. They changed comp plans to reward retention and NPS instead of just revenue. [▶ 55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UyitfSbY6c&t=3329s)
10. The CEO job shifts from 90% perspiration / 10% inspiration in startup mode to 90% inspiration / 10% perspiration at scale. Letting go of day-to-day work and expanding your "trust surface" are the hardest transitions. [▶ 1:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UyitfSbY6c&t=3703s)

> "There's a massive tax on optionality when you can move this fast and try a lot of things. It puts pressure on the CEOs to be faster and better decision makers." - Brian Halligan [▶ 36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UyitfSbY6c&t=2198s)

> "I think ye olde enterprise sales where there's actual trust built up between two carbon-based lifeforms, I think will be very, very, very late to go in the white-collar world." - Brian Halligan [▶ 28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UyitfSbY6c&t=1708s)

> "The thing about being a founder CEO is there's no one there to rescue you. Your parents aren't going to rescue you. Your VC is not going to rescue you... That kind of hits you when you hit your first crisis." - Brian Halligan [▶ 47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UyitfSbY6c&t=2826s)

## Topics Discussed
- **CEO Traits & the LOCKS Framework**: Halligan looks for Lovable, Obsessed, Chip on shoulder, Knowledgeable, Student of the game when evaluating founder-CEOs for Sequoia investments. The "five-tool CEO" (can code, has taste, has vision, can sell, can inspire) is a new breed exemplified by Brett Taylor. [▶ 17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UyitfSbY6c&t=1030s)
- **Hiring & Executive Team Building**: Advice includes doing blind references over trusting interviews, hiring "spiky" candidates over well-rounded ones, Parker Conrad's NDA/board-deck interview hack, and the "2004 Red Sox" approach of mixing homegrown talent with strategic external hires. [▶ 6:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UyitfSbY6c&t=374s)
- **AI's Impact on Go-to-Market**: Buyers will start their journeys in LLMs rather than Google. Websites will shift to AI avatar-based sales experiences. AEO (AI Engine Optimization) becomes the new SEO. Enterprise sales reps will bring AI SEs to every call. But the fundamental enterprise sales motion remains largely unchanged. [▶ 27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UyitfSbY6c&t=1671s)
- **Scaling vs Starting**: AI makes starting a company easier than ever, but the flood of new companies makes scaling harder. Distribution and breaking through the noise become the key challenges. [▶ 26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UyitfSbY6c&t=1566s)
- **How the CEO Job Has Changed**: Faster decision-making required, planning cycles compressed to quarterly, "tax on optionality" is higher, and the shift from perspiration to inspiration is critical at scale. [▶ 34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UyitfSbY6c&t=2085s)
- **Halliganisms (Operating Principles)**: "Don't nibble a shit sandwich" (make hard cuts all at once); "Never waste a good crisis" (overcorrect and use crises to drive lasting change); "If you want to kill a plant, have two people water it" (always assign a single DRI); "Two steps forward, one step back" (there are no silver bullets); EV > TV > MEV (always solve for enterprise value first). [▶ 38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UyitfSbY6c&t=2309s)
- **Customer-Centric vs Employee-Centric Culture**: HubSpot was #1 on Glassdoor but had low customer NPS. Halligan shifted the center of gravity to customers by changing comp plans, adding customer panels to management and board meetings, and explicitly measuring customer focus in performance reviews. [▶ 55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UyitfSbY6c&t=3329s)
- **Co-founder Dynamics**: Dharmesh Shah never had a single direct report at HubSpot in 20 years, allowing him to focus on thinking, creating, and tinkering while Halligan handled all management. [▶ 1:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UyitfSbY6c&t=3646s)
- **Life Lessons from a Near-Death Experience**: Halligan's severe snowmobile accident led him to step down as CEO. His life motto: "Life's short, don't waste it." Led to his transition to CEO coaching at Sequoia. [▶ 1:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UyitfSbY6c&t=4196s)

## Summary
Brian Halligan, co-founder and 20-year CEO of HubSpot turned Sequoia CEO coach, joins Lenny Rachitsky for a deep conversation about what it takes to lead a company in the AI era. Halligan now works with roughly 30 CEOs across two groups -- the "kids table" (under 100 employees) and the "adults table" (over 100) -- and shares the patterns he sees across the most successful founders. His central thesis: starting a company has never been easier thanks to AI, but scaling one has never been harder because the flood of new entrants creates unprecedented noise and competition.

On hiring, Halligan is emphatic that CEOs dramatically overrate their interviewing abilities and underrate blind references. He advocates for hiring "spiky" candidates with pronounced strengths rather than well-rounded people who score a 3/4 across the board. He recommends the "2004 Red Sox" approach to team building -- a core of homegrown talent supplemented by a few strategic external hires -- and warns against the common trap of being dazzled by big-company logos. At scale, roughly half a CEO's time should be spent on recruiting and building the executive team, and C-level turnover runs about two per year even at well-run companies like MongoDB.

Regarding AI's impact on business, Halligan sees enterprise sales as one of the last white-collar functions to be disrupted because it requires trust between humans. However, the top of the marketing funnel is about to change dramatically: buyers will start their research in ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude rather than Google, making AEO (AI Engine Optimization) the new SEO. Websites will evolve from static page hierarchies to AI avatar-based conversational experiences. Planning cycles have already compressed from annual to quarterly, and there is a growing "tax on optionality" -- CEOs who delay decisions to keep their options open get punished in a world moving this fast.

The interview also covers Halligan's "Halliganisms" -- hard-won operating principles including "don't nibble a shit sandwich" (make painful decisions all at once), "never waste a good crisis" (use setbacks to drive lasting structural change), and "if you want to kill a plant, have two people water it" (always assign a single DRI). He introduces his EV > TV > MEV framework, where managers must solve for enterprise value before team value before personal value, and describes how HubSpot deliberately shifted from being employee-centric (#1 on Glassdoor) to customer-centric by changing comp plans and embedding customer panels into every management and board meeting. The conversation closes with Halligan sharing how a near-fatal snowmobile accident -- 20+ broken bones, 33 screws -- gave him the clarity to step down as CEO and pursue coaching, crystallizing his life motto: "Life's short, don't waste it."
