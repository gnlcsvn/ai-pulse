# OpenAI's head of platform engineering on the next 12-24 months of AI

## Guests
- **Sherwin Wu** - Head of Engineering for API & Developer Platform, OpenAI

## Key Takeaways
1. 95% of OpenAI engineers use Codex daily and 100% of PRs are reviewed by Codex; engineers using Codex open 70% more PRs than those who don't, and the gap is widening [▶ 4:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=257s)
2. Engineers are becoming tech leads managing fleets of AI agents rather than writing code themselves -- the role of the software engineer has fundamentally changed in just a couple of years [▶ 0:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=9s)
3. The second and third order effects of the one-person billion-dollar startup are underpriced: expect a golden age of B2B SaaS with tens of thousands of small $10M startups building bespoke vertical software [▶ 24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=1476s)
4. Many enterprise AI deployments likely have negative ROI because they are top-down mandates without bottoms-up adoption; successful deployments require both executive buy-in and internal evangelists forming a tiger team [▶ 37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=2261s)
5. "The models will eat your scaffolding for breakfast" -- build for where models are going, not where they are today; vector stores, agent frameworks, and other scaffolding have repeatedly been disrupted by model improvements [▶ 46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=2702s)
6. Within 12-18 months, frontier models will be able to coherently handle multi-hour and potentially day-long tasks, fundamentally changing the types of products that can be built [▶ 50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=3051s)
7. Audio and multimodal models are a hugely underrated domain for enterprise; a lot of the world's business is conducted via audio, and major improvements are coming in the next 6-12 months [▶ 52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=3159s)
8. Business process automation is a massive underrated opportunity -- most work outside Silicon Valley consists of repeatable operations and standard procedures, not open-ended knowledge work [▶ 53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=3220s)
9. OpenAI views itself as a platform ecosystem company; every model released in a product gets released in the API, and they are committed to not squashing startups building on their platform [▶ 59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=3564s)
10. The next 2-3 years will be the most exciting period in tech; Sherwin encourages everyone to lean in and engage with AI tools now rather than take this moment for granted [▶ 68:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=4118s)

## Notable Quotes
> "Engineers are becoming tech leads. They're managing fleets and fleets of agents. It literally feels like we're wizards casting all these spells, and these spells are kind of like going out and doing things for you." - Sherwin Wu [▶ 0:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=9s)

> "To enable a one-person billion-dollar startup, there might be like a hundred other small startups building bespoke software. So I think we might actually enter into a golden age of B2B SaaS." - Sherwin Wu [▶ 26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=1578s)

> "Make sure you're building for where the models are going and not where they are today... There's a quote from Kevin Weil, our VP of science here. He likes saying this is the worst the models will ever be." - Sherwin Wu [▶ 49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=2948s)

> "We in Silicon Valley just forget that we live in a bubble. Most people in the world, most people in the US are not software engineers, are not very AI-pilled, are not following every single model release." - Sherwin Wu [▶ 38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=2323s)

> "I entered the workforce in 2014. It was great for a couple of years. I felt like there was a period of five to six years where it wasn't very exciting in tech. And then in the last three years, it's just been the most insanely exciting, energizing period of my career." - Sherwin Wu [▶ 68:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=4122s)

## Topics Discussed
- **AI-assisted coding at OpenAI**: Deep dive into how 95% of engineers use Codex daily, 100% of PRs are Codex-reviewed, and an internal team is running a 100% Codex-written codebase experiment. Engineers who use Codex heavily open 70% more PRs. [▶ 3:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=214s)
- **Evolving role of the software engineer**: Engineers are shifting from writing code to becoming tech leads who manage fleets of AI agents. Sherwin draws on the SICP "wizard book" and Sorcerer's Apprentice metaphors to describe how programming has become literal incantation. [▶ 7:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=432s)
- **Agent stress and 100% Codex codebase experiment**: Discussion of the new stress engineers feel when agents fail, and the fascinating learnings from a team maintaining a codebase with no human-written code. Key insight: most failures are due to under-specified prompts and lack of documented tribal knowledge. [▶ 12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=750s)
- **Engineering management in the AI era**: AI empowers top performers disproportionately; managers should spend 50%+ of time with top 10% of performers. Managers will be able to manage much larger teams with AI tools for organizational context. Surgeon analogy from The Mythical Man-Month applied to management philosophy. [▶ 19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=1170s)
- **One-person billion-dollar startup and second-order effects**: The real story is not the single unicorn but the explosion of small vertical startups it enables -- possibly tens of thousands of $10M companies. This could reshape the VC ecosystem. [▶ 24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=1476s)
- **Negative ROI on AI deployments**: Many enterprise AI deployments fail because of top-down mandates without bottoms-up adoption. Successful companies combine C-suite buy-in with internal tiger teams of technically-adjacent evangelists who build best practices and excitement. [▶ 37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=2261s)
- **"Models eat your scaffolding for breakfast"**: The scaffolding and tooling landscape shifts constantly as models improve. Vector stores, agent frameworks, and other abstractions have been disrupted repeatedly. Build products anticipating model improvements, aiming for capabilities that are 80% there today. [▶ 44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=2670s)
- **Next 12-18 months for the API and models**: Models will handle multi-hour to day-long tasks coherently. Audio/multimodal models will see major improvements. The Responses API is the most popular endpoint, with the Agents SDK and Agent Kits building higher-level abstractions. [▶ 50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=3018s)
- **Business process automation opportunity**: Hugely underrated outside Silicon Valley. Most work in the economy is repeatable processes with standard operating procedures, not open-ended knowledge work. AI is well-suited to automate these with high determinism. [▶ 53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=3220s)
- **OpenAI as platform company**: OpenAI sees itself as an ecosystem platform, releasing every model to the API, keeping the platform neutral, and launching the ChatGPT app store and Sign in with ChatGPT. 800 million weekly active users. Mission-driven: spreading AGI benefits to all of humanity. [▶ 57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=3469s)

## Summary
Sherwin Wu, head of engineering for OpenAI's API and developer platform, provides a deeply detailed look at how AI is transforming software engineering from the inside. At OpenAI, 95% of engineers use Codex daily, 100% of pull requests are reviewed by Codex, and engineers who lean heavily into the tool open 70% more PRs than those who do not. An experimental team is maintaining a 100% Codex-written codebase, surfacing important lessons about the need for documented tribal knowledge and well-specified prompts to make AI agents effective. The role of the software engineer has shifted from writing code to becoming a tech lead managing fleets of agents -- a transformation Sherwin likens to the Sorcerer's Apprentice and the "wizard" metaphors from MIT's legendary SICP textbook.

On the business side, Sherwin argues that the second and third order effects of the one-person billion-dollar startup are underpriced. Rather than just one massive company, he envisions a golden age of B2B SaaS with an explosion of small, vertical startups building bespoke software for each other. This could mean tens of thousands of $10 million companies, which would be transformative for individual entrepreneurs even if less exciting for traditional venture capital. He also highlights that many enterprise AI deployments have negative ROI because they are top-down mandates without the critical ingredient of bottoms-up adoption, recommending companies form internal tiger teams of technically-adjacent evangelists to drive genuine adoption.

Looking ahead, Sherwin is most excited about two major trends in the next 12-18 months: models that can coherently handle multi-hour and potentially day-long tasks (dramatically expanding what products can be built), and significant improvements in multimodal audio models for enterprise use cases. He repeatedly emphasizes building for where models are going, not where they are today, citing the pattern of models "eating scaffolding for breakfast" -- vector stores, agent frameworks, and other abstractions have all been disrupted as models improved. He also makes a strong case for business process automation as a massively underrated opportunity, noting that most work outside Silicon Valley consists of repeatable procedures rather than open-ended knowledge work.

Finally, Sherwin reaffirms OpenAI's commitment to being a platform ecosystem company. Every model ships to the API, the platform remains neutral, and with 800 million weekly active users on ChatGPT (roughly 10% of the world's population) plus the upcoming app store, OpenAI sees fostering this ecosystem as core to its mission of spreading the benefits of AGI to all of humanity. His parting message is one of urgency and optimism: the next two to three years will be the most exciting period in tech, and he encourages everyone to lean in rather than take this moment for granted.
