# Head of Claude Code: What Happens After Coding Is Solved

## Guests
- **Boris Cherny** - Head of Claude Code, Anthropic (formerly at Meta/Instagram)
- **Lenny Rachitsky** - Host, Lenny's Podcast (interviewer)

## Key Takeaways
1. Boris Cherny writes 100% of his code with Claude Code, has not edited a single line by hand since November 2025, and ships 10-30 pull requests per day [▶ 16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We7BZVKbCVw&t=980s)
2. Coding is "largely solved" for the kinds of programming Boris does; the frontier is now moving beyond code to general computer tasks via the Coworker product [▶ 18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We7BZVKbCVw&t=1100s)
3. Claude Code is now autonomously coming up with ideas by analyzing feedback, bug reports, and telemetry - behaving more like a coworker than a tool [▶ 17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We7BZVKbCVw&t=1076s)
4. Productivity per engineer at Anthropic has increased 200% as measured by pull requests, a figure Boris calls extraordinary based on his experience running code quality at Meta [▶ 21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We7BZVKbCVw&t=1283s)
5. Claude Code's daily active users "went vertical" after launch and have doubled in just the past month, with growth still accelerating [▶ 11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We7BZVKbCVw&t=698s)
6. The best historical analogy for AI coding is the printing press: literacy went from sub-1% to universal, and in 50 years after Gutenberg more material was printed than in the prior thousand years [▶ 32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We7BZVKbCVw&t=1974s)
7. The title of "software engineer" is going to start to go away and be replaced by "builder" - everyone will be a product manager and everyone will code [▶ 43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We7BZVKbCVw&t=2597s)
8. Boris's key advice for companies adopting AI coding: don't try to optimize costs at the beginning - give engineers unlimited tokens and use the most capable model available [▶ 26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We7BZVKbCVw&t=1566s)
9. Claude Code was not initially a hit when launched externally - it took many months for people to understand what it was, before adoption went vertical [▶ 11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We7BZVKbCVw&t=716s)
10. Coworker was evaluated against 50 non-technical use cases before release, and it could handle 48 out of 50 tasks successfully [▶ 83:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We7BZVKbCVw&t=5021s)

## Summary
In this wide-ranging conversation on Lenny's Podcast, Boris Cherny, Head of Claude Code at Anthropic, shares the remarkable story of how a "little hack" at Anthropic Labs grew into one of the most transformative developer tools in history, approaching its one-year anniversary. Boris reveals that he writes 100% of his code using Claude Code, has not manually edited a single line since November 2025, and ships 10 to 30 pull requests per day while running approximately five AI agents in parallel. At Anthropic, Claude now reviews 100% of pull requests, and productivity per engineer has increased 200% as measured by PR output.

Boris makes the bold claim that "coding is largely solved" for the kinds of programming he does and describes the next frontier: AI that goes beyond writing code to autonomously analyzing feedback, identifying bugs from telemetry, and proposing what to build next. This is embodied in Anthropic's Coworker product, which Boris uses for everything from project management to paying parking tickets. He envisions a future where the title "software engineer" fades away, replaced by "builder," and where everyone - product managers, designers, and non-technical people alike - will be able to code. He acknowledges this transition will be painful but frames it as fundamentally democratizing.

The most striking analytical framework Boris offers is the printing press analogy. Before Gutenberg, literacy in Europe was sub-1%, controlled by scribes employed by often-illiterate lords and kings. In the 50 years after the printing press, more material was printed than in the prior thousand years, and the cost of books dropped roughly 100x. Boris argues that programming is undergoing the same transformation: today only a small percentage of the population can write software, but AI is making this capability universal. Just as scribes feared the printing press but literacy ultimately created entirely new professions, AI coding will create opportunities we cannot yet imagine.

On practical advice for companies adopting AI coding tools, Boris counsels against premature cost optimization. His recommendation is to give engineers unlimited tokens and use the most capable model available, noting that less capable models often end up costing more because they require more tokens and retries to complete the same task. He also shares that unlimited AI tokens are becoming a recruiting perk at top companies. For his own workflow, he emphasizes running multiple agents in parallel, staying current with the latest model versions, and maintaining the discipline of understanding the layer beneath the abstraction you work at.

The interview closes with a personal reflection on post-AGI life. Before joining Anthropic, Boris lived in rural Japan, where he made miso, traded pickles with neighbors, and biked past rice paddies to the farmer's market. He suggests that this kind of slow, deliberate craftsmanship - building things with your hands, nurturing relationships with neighbors - may be exactly what matters most in a world where AI handles the intellectual labor.
