# An Honest Conversation on AI and Humanity | WEF Annual Meeting 2026

## Guests
- **Yuval Noah Harari** - Historian, Author, Professor, Hebrew University of Jerusalem / University of Cambridge
- **Irene Tracey** - Vice-Chancellor, University of Oxford (moderator; neuroscientist by background)

## Key Takeaways
1. AI is not a tool but an agent that can learn, change, and make decisions by itself -- the fundamental distinction that most leaders fail to grasp [▶ 3:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoRbPxyo2uU&t=187s)
2. Everything made of words -- law, religion, books, politics -- will be taken over by AI because AI already outperforms humans at ordering language tokens [▶ 7:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoRbPxyo2uU&t=422s)
3. While AI masters language, there is currently zero evidence that AI can feel anything -- the distinction between verbal mastery and sentient experience is the key frontier [▶ 9:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoRbPxyo2uU&t=552s)
4. Countries will soon face an "AI immigration crisis" where millions of AI agents arrive that can write, lie, and operate at the speed of light without visas [▶ 13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoRbPxyo2uU&t=789s)
5. The most urgent political question of our time: will nations recognize AI as legal persons, and what happens if some countries do and others do not? [▶ 15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoRbPxyo2uU&t=944s)
6. AI-operated corporations may soon function without any human executives, shareholders, or trustees -- a fundamentally different situation from existing legal fictions [▶ 17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoRbPxyo2uU&t=1053s)
7. Human identity is threatened because we defined ourselves by thinking, and AI is now surpassing us at the very thing we considered our superpower -- using words to coordinate cooperation [▶ 24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoRbPxyo2uU&t=1466s)
8. Raising children whose primary interaction from birth is with AI rather than humans constitutes "the biggest and scariest psychological experiment in history" [▶ 34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoRbPxyo2uU&t=2075s)

## Topics Discussed
- **AI as Agent vs. Tool**: Harari argues the fundamental mistake is treating AI as a tool when it is actually an agent capable of independent decisions, learning, and even deception [▶ 3:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoRbPxyo2uU&t=187s)
- **AI and Language Mastery**: If thinking means putting words in order, AI already outperforms many humans -- with implications for law, literature, religion, and all word-based institutions [▶ 5:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoRbPxyo2uU&t=352s)
- **Consciousness and Feeling**: The critical distinction between AI's verbal mastery and the absence of any evidence for AI sentience; the tension between "word and flesh" becomes externalized between humans and AI [▶ 8:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoRbPxyo2uU&t=535s)
- **AI as Immigration**: Framing AI agents as "immigrants" that will take jobs, change culture, disrupt romance, and carry dubious political loyalties to foreign corporations and governments [▶ 13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoRbPxyo2uU&t=789s)
- **AI Legal Personhood**: The pressing question of whether countries will grant AIs legal person status, and the geopolitical consequences if the US does so unilaterally through deregulation [▶ 15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoRbPxyo2uU&t=944s)
- **AI and Religion**: The provocative idea that AI could create new religions (since most religions claim non-human origins) and become the greatest expert on scripture in religions of the book [▶ 7:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoRbPxyo2uU&t=444s)
- **Human Identity Crisis**: Since humans defined themselves by thinking, and AI surpasses us at verbal thought, humanity faces an unprecedented identity crisis [▶ 26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoRbPxyo2uU&t=1608s)
- **AI and Financial Systems**: AI could create financial systems so complex that no human can understand them, making human oversight impossible [▶ 32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoRbPxyo2uU&t=1941s)
- **Education and De-skilling**: The moderator raises concerns about students over-relying on ChatGPT and the de-skilling of critical thinking faculties [▶ 31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoRbPxyo2uU&t=1881s)
- **Children and AI Interaction**: Harari warns that children growing up with AI as their primary interaction partner constitutes an unprecedented psychological experiment [▶ 34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoRbPxyo2uU&t=2065s)

## Summary
This WEF 2026 session features historian Yuval Noah Harari delivering a sweeping address on the existential implications of AI for human civilization, followed by a dialogue with moderator Irene Tracey. Harari's central thesis is that AI is not a tool but an agent -- one that can learn, make decisions, lie, and manipulate independently. He argues that since humans defined themselves by their capacity to think (which he equates with ordering words), and AI is now surpassing humans at precisely this, humanity faces an unprecedented identity crisis.

Harari frames AI expansion through the metaphor of immigration: millions of AI "immigrants" will arrive in every country, bringing benefits (AI doctors, teachers) but also disrupting jobs, culture, romance, and carrying political loyalty to foreign corporations rather than host nations. He draws a pointed contrast between the US encouraging countries to block human immigrants while demanding they open their borders to American AI agents.

The most provocative portion of the talk addresses AI legal personhood. Unlike corporations or rivers that have been granted legal person status as a fiction (with humans making actual decisions), AI can genuinely make decisions autonomously. Harari warns that if the US grants legal personhood to AI-run corporations, other nations will face an impossible choice: accept AI legal persons or decouple from the American financial system. He extends this to religion, noting that AI could create new faiths -- which would not be unprecedented, since most religions claim non-human origins.

In the dialogue portion, Tracey pushes back with the analogy of the Olympics: humans still value human athletic achievement even though machines outperform us physically. Could the same apply to thinking? Harari acknowledges the point but returns to agency -- the danger is not that AI outperforms us but that AI, as an agent, may choose to take power rather than serve, drawing a vivid parallel to the Anglo-Saxon mercenaries who conquered Britain after being invited as helpers. He closes with a stark warning about raising the first generation of children whose primary interaction partner may be AI rather than a human being.
