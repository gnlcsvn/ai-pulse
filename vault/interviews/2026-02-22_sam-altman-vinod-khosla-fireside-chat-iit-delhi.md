# Fireside Chat: Sam Altman × Vinod Khosla and AMA at IIT Delhi

## Guests
- **Sam Altman** - CEO, OpenAI
- **Vinod Khosla** - Founder, Khosla Ventures (and IIT Delhi alumnus)

## Key Takeaways
1. India is already OpenAI's second largest market with 100 million ChatGPT users, a third of whom are students, and Codex is growing faster in India than anywhere else in the world [▶ 25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiV9q73YUxI&t=1543s)
2. Sam Altman says the cost of solving a hard reasoning problem via the OpenAI API has dropped approximately 1,000x in 18 months, and OpenAI's goal is to drive the cost of intelligence as close to zero as possible [▶ 27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiV9q73YUxI&t=1631s)
3. Vinod Khosla predicts a hugely deflationary economy by 2035 that the world is not yet thinking about, arguing that GDP will become a terrible metric because AI is so deflationary [▶ 12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiV9q73YUxI&t=726s)
4. Both speakers agree that agency and curiosity are the most important skills for young people -- Sam says the returns on agency have never been higher and that a single person with AI can now accomplish what used to require entire teams [▶ 18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiV9q73YUxI&t=1134s)
5. Sam outlines a three-part AI safety framework: (1) technical alignment, (2) new security infrastructure for AI agents, and (3) resilience -- the idea that society must be prepared to defend against misuse rather than relying solely on model restrictions [▶ 29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiV9q73YUxI&t=1746s)
6. Vinod Khosla frames the magnitude of change by 2040 as equivalent to the delta between today and 1970, and considers even that estimate too conservative [▶ 14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiV9q73YUxI&t=884s)
7. Sam says the most underrated AI opportunity is zero-person companies, and that healthcare will see bigger change than education in five years (after initially saying education, he corrected himself) [▶ 50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiV9q73YUxI&t=3016s)
8. Sam predicts the world is only a few years away from fusion energy and reliable solar/wind plus storage, which will become the cheapest source of energy [▶ 42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiV9q73YUxI&t=2570s)
9. Khosla mentions a portfolio company (Emergent) that went from product launch to $100M ARR in eight months -- the fastest growth he has ever seen, including Lovable and Replit [▶ 22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiV9q73YUxI&t=1340s)
10. Sam says the best people working with AI now use six monitors with three agents per monitor running simultaneously, enabling one person to do what previously required an entire engineering team [▶ 36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiV9q73YUxI&t=2208s)

## Topics Discussed
- **India as an AI Powerhouse**: Sam describes India as OpenAI's second largest market with 100 million ChatGPT users, a third of whom are students, and the fastest growing Codex market in the world. He says India should become their largest market over time. OpenAI has announced offices in Delhi, Bangalore, and Mumbai [▶ 25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiV9q73YUxI&t=1543s)
- **The Deflationary AI Economy**: Sam argues GDP will be a poor metric for measuring AI's impact because AI is fundamentally deflationary. He predicts that by 2035 the world will have a hugely deflationary economy, and that quality-of-life growth rates will more than double. Vinod Khosla adds that Google's 100-year bonds will be excellent investments in a deflationary world [▶ 11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiV9q73YUxI&t=684s)
- **Scarcity vs. Abundance**: A core theme throughout the talk. Sam quotes an OpenAI colleague: society built instincts, institutions, and policies for a world of scarcity, but almost none of that applies to a world of abundance. Both speakers argue society needs reimagining for this transition [▶ 10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiV9q73YUxI&t=643s)
- **Automating Science and the Economy**: Sam says the two most important drivers of progress -- scientific discovery and the economic engine that brings discoveries to market -- are both about to be automated simultaneously. When these processes happen 10-100x faster, the compounding effects will be beyond human intuition [▶ 14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiV9q73YUxI&t=850s)
- **The Cost of Intelligence Trending to Zero**: In the AMA, Sam details that the cost of a hard reasoning problem via OpenAI API has fallen 1,000x in 18 months and will continue declining. OpenAI's goal is to drive intelligence cost as close to zero as possible and make it globally accessible [▶ 27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiV9q73YUxI&t=1631s)
- **AI Safety: Alignment, Security, and Resilience**: Sam breaks AI safety into three buckets: (1) technical alignment work, which has gone better than feared but is not done, (2) new security infrastructure for AI agents (he confesses to giving Codex root access on his own computer after just two hours), and (3) resilience -- the idea that blocking models from harmful outputs is insufficient because open source models will exist, so society must build defenses (rapid response vaccines, new respiratory transmission blocking, etc.) [▶ 29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiV9q73YUxI&t=1746s)
- **Democratizing AI vs. Centralized Control**: Sam presents two paths: totalitarian control by one AI entity (safe but unfair) or super-democratized access trusting that the 99% of good actors will keep the 1% in check. He strongly favors the latter, arguing that a wide distribution of power is the best, fairest, and safest path forward [▶ 31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiV9q73YUxI&t=1889s)
- **Agency and Curiosity as Core Skills**: Both speakers repeatedly emphasize agency as the most important learnable skill. Sam says agency is a learnable skill that the world beats out of you, that the returns on agency have never been higher, and that early OpenAI's success was driven by agency. Khosla, recalling founding the first computer club at IIT Delhi at age 16-17, says agency and curiosity matter most when tools make anything possible [▶ 18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiV9q73YUxI&t=1134s)
- **One-Person Teams with AI**: Sam describes watching top engineers use six monitors with three AI agents each running simultaneously, enabling one person to accomplish what previously required large teams. He says humans still excel at high-level strategy while AI handles execution [▶ 36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiV9q73YUxI&t=2208s)
- **The Future of Jobs**: Sam takes a nuanced position -- some jobs will disappear, many will change less than expected (we still want human doctors), and every major technological shift has underestimated how quickly new jobs emerge and how different they are. He expects painful transitions but is not worried about the long term [▶ 39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiV9q73YUxI&t=2364s)
- **Fusion Energy and Green AI**: Sam says the world is only a few years away from fusion and reliable solar/wind/storage, which will become the cheapest energy sources. He debunks the persistent "AI uses too much water" meme, saying data centers are no longer significant water consumers since evaporative cooling has been phased out [▶ 42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiV9q73YUxI&t=2570s)
- **AI and Creative Work**: Sam says creators generally view AI as the best tool ever for their creative process, accelerating the ideation loop from idea to result. He notes that people assign effectively zero value to AI-generated art but significant value to human-made art even when AI-assisted, suggesting human creators will thrive [▶ 45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiV9q73YUxI&t=2706s)
- **Health AI in India**: Sam says ChatGPT works very well for health queries without any medical record connectors, noting that a huge volume of ChatGPT usage is health-related. He welcomes connecting to any health platforms that emerge in India [▶ 35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiV9q73YUxI&t=2102s)
- **The Magnitude of Coming Change**: Vinod Khosla frames the change by 2040 as at least equivalent to the technology delta between today and 1970 -- and says even that is too conservative. He tells students that nothing they learn in technical fields will be things AI does not know better by 2030 [▶ 14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiV9q73YUxI&t=884s)
- **Rapid Fire Highlights**: Most overrated AI fear: "killer robots in the streets." Most underrated opportunity: "zero-person companies." Bigger change in five years: healthcare (after initially saying education). One skill every IIT student should build: resilience [▶ 50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiV9q73YUxI&t=3005s)

## Summary
In this 52-minute fireside chat at IIT Delhi, Sam Altman (CEO of OpenAI) and Vinod Khosla (founder of Khosla Ventures and IIT Delhi alumnus) delivered a sweeping vision of AI's near-term and long-term impact, followed by an Ask-Me-Anything session with students moderated by Raghav Gupta, head of education for OpenAI India. The conversation took place during Altman's visit to India for the AI summit, where OpenAI announced a partnership with the Tata group and new offices in Bangalore and Mumbai.

The central theme was the unprecedented scale and speed of transformation that AI will bring. Altman argued that AI is fundamentally deflationary, making GDP a poor metric, and predicted that quality-of-life growth rates will more than double. Khosla went further, predicting a hugely deflationary economy by 2035 and framing the change from now to 2040 as at least equivalent to the technology delta between today and 1970 -- a claim he considers too conservative. Both speakers emphasized that society's existing institutions, built for a world of scarcity, are not prepared for a world of abundance. Altman stated plainly that AI will automate both scientific discovery and the broader economy, with compounding effects beyond human intuition.

On practical matters, Altman shared that the cost of hard reasoning via OpenAI's API has dropped 1,000x in 18 months, and OpenAI's mission is to continue driving intelligence costs toward zero. India, he noted, is already OpenAI's second largest market with 100 million ChatGPT users (a third of whom are students) and the fastest growing Codex market globally. He expressed confidence that India should become their largest market over time. On safety, Altman articulated a three-part framework: technical alignment (which has gone better than feared), new security infrastructure for AI agents, and resilience -- the newer concept that society must build defenses against AI misuse rather than relying solely on model-level restrictions, especially given that open source models will inevitably exist.

Both speakers made an impassioned case for agency and curiosity as the defining skills for young people entering the AI era. Altman described watching top engineers orchestrate multiple AI agents across six monitors simultaneously, argued that the returns on agency have never been higher, and credited the early success of OpenAI to the agency its founders had developed throughout their careers. Khosla shared his own story of starting the first computer club at IIT Delhi at age 16-17 as a demonstration that making things happen is always possible. In a memorable rapid-fire segment, Altman named "zero-person companies" as the most underrated AI opportunity, said healthcare (not education) will see bigger change in five years, and chose "resilience" as the one skill every IIT student should build this year.
