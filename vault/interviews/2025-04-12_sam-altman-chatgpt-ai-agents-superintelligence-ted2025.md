# OpenAI's Sam Altman Talks ChatGPT, AI Agents and Superintelligence -- Live at TED2025

## Guests
- **Sam Altman** - CEO, OpenAI
- **Chris Anderson** - Head of TED (interviewer)

## Key Takeaways
1. ChatGPT has reached 500 million weekly active users and is growing at an unprecedented rate -- Altman says he has never seen growth like this in any company [▶ 9:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MWT_doo68k&t=581s)
2. OpenAI is planning to release a "very powerful open source model" near the frontier, better than any current open source model, acknowledging they were "late to act" on open source [▶ 8:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MWT_doo68k&t=482s)
3. Very smart models will be commoditized -- OpenAI's competitive edge will come from building the best integrated product, not just the best model [▶ 10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MWT_doo68k&t=631s)
4. AI for science is what Altman is personally most excited about, with meaningful progress against disease expected and room-temperature superconductors considered plausible [▶ 13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MWT_doo68k&t=811s)
5. Agentic software engineering will see "another move that big" in the coming months, comparable to the transformation of the past two years [▶ 14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MWT_doo68k&t=878s)
6. Agentic AI is "the most interesting and consequential safety challenge we have yet faced" -- users will not adopt agents they cannot trust with their data and systems [▶ 24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MWT_doo68k&t=1464s)
7. ChatGPT's new memory feature will evolve toward an always-on companion that gets to know you over the course of your lifetime -- "the upload happens bit by bit" [▶ 12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MWT_doo68k&t=744s)
8. Rather than debating a single AGI moment, Altman urges recognizing we are on "this long exponential" that will go "way beyond what any of us would call AGI" -- the focus should be on safety through every step [▶ 20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MWT_doo68k&t=1223s)
9. Altman has evolved away from proposing a government licensing agency for AI, now favoring external safety testing frameworks and rigorous model evaluation as systems approach frontier capabilities [▶ 28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MWT_doo68k&t=1719s)
10. OpenAI is shifting to a more permissive stance on content guardrails, allowing users more freedom on speech-related outputs while maintaining hard limits on real-world harms [▶ 27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MWT_doo68k&t=1649s)

## Notable Quotes
> "I have never seen growth in any company, one that I've been involved with or not, like this, like the growth of ChatGPT." - Sam Altman [▶ 9:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MWT_doo68k&t=561s)

> "Very smart models will be commoditized to some degree. I think we'll have the best and for some use you'll want that. But honestly, the models are now so smart that for most of the things most people want to do, they're good enough." - Sam Altman [▶ 10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MWT_doo68k&t=631s)

> "We have to build a great product, not just a great model." - Sam Altman [▶ 11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MWT_doo68k&t=685s)

> "You will talk to ChatGPT over the course of your life someday. Maybe if you want, it'll be listening to you throughout the day and sort of observing what you're doing, and it'll get to know you, and it'll become this extension of yourself." - Sam Altman [▶ 12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MWT_doo68k&t=744s)

> "I think the creative spirit of humanity is an incredibly important thing, and we want to build tools that lift that up." - Sam Altman [▶ 3:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MWT_doo68k&t=186s)

> "A good product is a safe product. You will not use our agents if you do not trust that they're not going to empty your bank account or delete your data." - Sam Altman [▶ 24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MWT_doo68k&t=1464s)

> "This is like a discovery of fundamental physics that the world now knows about, and it's going to be part of our world." - Sam Altman [▶ 27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MWT_doo68k&t=1649s)

> "We have to embrace this with caution, but not fear, or we will get run by with other people that use AI to do better things." - Sam Altman [▶ 27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MWT_doo68k&t=1663s)

> "My kids hopefully will never be smarter than AI. They will never grow up in a world where products and services are not incredibly smart, incredibly capable." - Sam Altman [▶ 45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MWT_doo68k&t=2755s)

> "I hope that my kids and all of your kids will look back at us with some pity and nostalgia and be like, they lived such horrible lives, they were so limited." - Sam Altman [▶ 46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MWT_doo68k&t=2804s)

## Summary
In this wide-ranging 47-minute conversation at TED2025, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman spoke with Chris Anderson about the explosive growth of ChatGPT, the future of AI agents, and the challenges of building safe systems on an exponential capability curve. Altman revealed that ChatGPT had reached 500 million weekly active users and was growing faster than anything he had ever seen, while also acknowledging that very smart AI models would increasingly be commoditized -- making product quality, not just model capability, the key differentiator.

On the technical frontier, Altman expressed the most excitement about AI for science, predicting meaningful progress against disease in the near term and describing room-temperature superconductors as not "prevented by the laws of physics." He also predicted another major transformation in software development "in the coming months" through agentic software engineering, noting that engineers were already having "religious-like moments" doing in an afternoon what previously took two years.

The conversation dove deep into the safety implications of agentic AI, which Altman called "the most interesting and consequential safety challenge we have yet faced." He argued that safety and capability are converging -- users will not adopt agents they cannot trust. Rather than fixating on an AGI definition or moment, Altman urged the audience to recognize the continuous exponential curve of AI capability that will go "way beyond what any of us would call AGI."

On governance, Altman revealed he had moved away from his earlier Senate testimony proposing a government licensing agency, now favoring external safety testing frameworks. He also announced OpenAI would release a powerful near-frontier open source model, acknowledging they were "late to act" on open source. Throughout, he struck a balance between acknowledging legitimate fears about the pace of change and expressing confidence that society would figure out how to navigate it, closing with a vision of a future of "incredible material abundance" that future generations would take for granted.
