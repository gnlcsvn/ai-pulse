# NVIDIA's Jensen Huang on Reasoning Models, Robotics, and Refuting the AI Bubble Narrative

## Guests
- **Jensen Huang** - CEO, NVIDIA

## Key Takeaways
1. AI automates tasks, not purposes -- radiologists were not replaced despite 100% of radiology becoming AI-powered; instead, their numbers increased because AI enhanced their ability to diagnose disease (the purpose), even as it automated scanning (the task) [▶ 9:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-xtmISBCNE&t=543s)
2. Three new categories of physical plants are being built in the US at massive scale -- chip plants, supercomputer plants, and AI factories -- creating an enormous boom in skilled labor jobs (electricians, plumbers, technicians, network engineers) [▶ 6:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-xtmISBCNE&t=397s)
3. Reasoning token generation for inference is growing at multiple exponentials simultaneously, and these tokens are now profitable -- companies like OpenEvidence are running at 90% gross margins [▶ 2:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-xtmISBCNE&t=122s)
4. The cost of AI token generation could decrease by a billion times over 10 years, driven by compounding hardware improvements (5-10x annually), algorithm advances, and model architecture innovations [▶ 32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-xtmISBCNE&t=1940s)
5. "God AI" (a single model that understands all modalities supremely well) is nowhere near existing and is an unhelpful framing -- the real opportunity is in diverse, specialized AI across biology, chemistry, physics, finance, and more [▶ 22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-xtmISBCNE&t=1323s)
6. Digital biology is about to have its "ChatGPT moment" -- multi-protein understanding, protein generation, and chemical confirmation are converging with synthetic data and long-context multimodal models [▶ 44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-xtmISBCNE&t=2644s)
7. Robotics will progress much faster than self-driving cars did, skipping the 10-15 year slog, because foundational technologies (end-to-end models, reasoning) already exist -- "everything that moves will be robotic" [▶ 49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-xtmISBCNE&t=2951s)
8. DeepSeek was "probably the single most important paper" and "the single greatest contribution to American AI" -- a concrete example of how open source from China benefits the entire global ecosystem [▶ 33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-xtmISBCNE&t=2012s)
9. We are not in an AI bubble -- NVIDIA would be a multi-hundred-billion-dollar company even without chatbots, because the fundamental shift from general-purpose to accelerated computing is happening regardless [▶ 66:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-xtmISBCNE&t=3981s)
10. The doomer narrative around AI has done real damage -- it scared people away from investing in the very technology that makes AI safer, more functional, and more useful to society [▶ 24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-xtmISBCNE&t=1469s)

## Topics Discussed
- **Task vs. Purpose Framework**: Huang's central thesis that AI automates tasks (scanning, coding, typing) but not the purpose of jobs (diagnosing disease, solving problems, protecting clients), explaining why employment grows even as AI pervades industries [▶ 9:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-xtmISBCNE&t=543s)
- **Jobs and Labor Shortage**: Three new types of plants (chip, supercomputer, AI factory) are creating massive construction and technical labor demand; robots will fill existing labor shortages in factories and trucking, not displace workers [▶ 6:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-xtmISBCNE&t=397s)
- **Open Source AI**: Essential for startups, education, healthcare, manufacturing -- without it, 100-year-old industrial companies would be "suffocated"; China's open-source contributions (especially DeepSeek) directly benefited American AI [▶ 18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-xtmISBCNE&t=1134s)
- **AI Cost Economics (Tokenomics)**: AI compute improving 5-10x annually (vs Moore's Law 2x/1.5yr); combination of hardware + algorithms + model architecture driving costs down >10x/year; training cost also declining rapidly [▶ 31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-xtmISBCNE&t=1898s)
- **Reasoning Models**: The application of reasoning across language, vision, robotics, and self-driving was 2025's biggest advance; reasoning models will make self-driving cars safer and enable robots to handle novel situations [▶ 48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-xtmISBCNE&t=2904s)
- **Robotics**: Huang is more optimistic about robotics than self-driving because foundational tech already exists; everything that moves will be robotic; expect diverse form factors beyond humanoids [▶ 49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-xtmISBCNE&t=2951s)
- **Digital Biology**: Protein understanding advancing rapidly; multi-protein understanding and generation coming online; NVIDIA's LotProteinA model released; synthetic data critical for sparse biological datasets [▶ 44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-xtmISBCNE&t=2644s)
- **Self-Driving Cars**: Four eras -- smart sensors, modular deep learning, end-to-end models, end-to-end with reasoning; NVIDIA's AV stack rated #1 for safety globally, Tesla #2 [▶ 48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-xtmISBCNE&t=2932s)
- **Energy and AI**: Without energy growth there can be no new industry; natural gas is the only practical near-term answer; AI demand is actually the biggest driver of sustainable energy investment [▶ 54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-xtmISBCNE&t=3284s)
- **AI Bubble Narrative**: Huang argues the question is too simplistic -- even without chatbots, the shift from general-purpose to accelerated computing makes NVIDIA a multi-hundred-billion company; AI extends far beyond chatbots into AV, digital biology, financial services, robotics [▶ 64:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-xtmISBCNE&t=3886s)
- **AI Safety**: The first principle of safety is performance (does it work as advertised?); as marginal cost of AI drops, one AI will be monitored by millions of AIs; the doomer narrative scared people from investing in the technology that makes AI safer [▶ 27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-xtmISBCNE&t=1654s)
- **NVIDIA Architecture Strategy**: Programmable GPUs beat fixed ASICs because the AI algorithm landscape changes too rapidly; architectural compatibility across generations means a huge install base; MVLink 72 is the lowest-cost token generation platform [▶ 42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-xtmISBCNE&t=2574s)
- **US-China Relations**: Decoupling is naive; the two nations are deeply coupled; China's internet boom benefited American chip companies enormously; a nuanced strategy is needed, not extremes [▶ 58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-xtmISBCNE&t=3539s)
- **Pre-training vs. Post-training**: Pre-training is not over; the point of pre-training is to prepare for real training (post-training); compute scaling directly translates to intelligence; data needed for training is getting smaller [▶ 36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-xtmISBCNE&t=2197s)

## Summary
In this wide-ranging interview with the No Priors podcast hosts, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang presents an optimistic but grounded view of AI's trajectory heading into 2026. His central framework distinguishes between the "task" of a job (what you do) and its "purpose" (why you do it), arguing that AI automates tasks while expanding the capacity to fulfill purpose -- which is why employment tends to grow even in AI-saturated fields like radiology.

Huang pushes back forcefully against several dominant narratives. On the jobs front, he points to massive labor shortages in manufacturing, trucking, nursing, and accounting, arguing that robots and AI will fill gaps rather than displace workers. On the "AI bubble," he reframes the discussion: NVIDIA's business rests on the fundamental shift from general-purpose to accelerated computing, which would be a multi-hundred-billion-dollar transition even without chatbots. AI extends into autonomous vehicles (approaching $10 billion for NVIDIA), digital biology, financial services, and robotics.

On technology, Huang offers striking numbers: AI compute is improving 5-10x annually (compared to Moore's Law's 2x every 18 months), meaning a 100,000x to 1,000,000x improvement over a decade in hardware alone. Combined with algorithmic gains, he says a billion-fold reduction in token generation costs over 10 years would not surprise him. He is particularly excited about digital biology having its "ChatGPT moment" in 2026, reasoning models enabling safer self-driving cars, and robotics progressing much faster than self-driving did.

Huang is pointedly critical of the "doomer narrative," saying well-respected people have done real damage by painting science-fiction scenarios that scare investment away from the technology that makes AI safer and more useful. He champions open source as essential infrastructure, calling DeepSeek "probably the single greatest contribution to American AI last year," and argues that US-China decoupling is naive. On energy, he says AI demand is paradoxically becoming the biggest driver of sustainable energy investment, though natural gas remains the only practical bridge for the coming decade.
